Under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on April 15, 2014, on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors grants each continuing non-employee director an RSU award that shall vest on approximately the first anniversary of the date of grant at no cost covering a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $150,000 (or $225,000 for the Chairperson of the Board) divided by the fair market value of the Company’s common stock as of the date of grant; provided that any former employee of the Company must have served as a non-employee director for at least six months in order to receive such award.  As Chairman of the Board, Mr.

Bogen, Cash, Enloe, Lazar, Walker and Wood each received a grant of 2,992 RSUs on the date of the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders.
Amounts shown do not reflect compensation actually received by the director, but represent the grant date fair value as determined pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock Compensation (“ASC Topic 718”).  The assumptions underlying the calculation are discussed under Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, of the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015.

The Compensation Committee regularly reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that it achieves the desired goal of aligning our executive compensation structure with the interests of our stockholders and current market practices.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of our compensation program for the Named Executive Officers during 2014 as administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”).
Finally, it explains how and why the Compensation Committee arrived at the specific compensation decisions for our Named Executive Officers in 2014, and discusses the key factors that the Compensation Committee considered in determining their compensation.
Our Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, sets the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.
For 2014, the Compensation Committee took the following actions with respect to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers:
The compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee does not provide any other services to the Company.
The Compensation Committee designs the various components of our executive compensation program to support our culture and efforts to remain a growth company with strong profitability.
Our FY12 MSU grant required our TSR to match the index to earn the targeted MSU shares.  In FY13, the Compensation Committee increased the level of performance required to earn the targeted MSU shares.  All MSU awards granted after the beginning of our 2013 fiscal year require that our TSR exceed the TSR of the XSOX by 25 points (i.e., if the XSOX delivers TSR of 20%, our TSR must be 45%) for the targeted number of shares to be earned.  Furthermore, if we deliver TSR that simply matches that of the XSOX, MSU participants earn just 61.5% of their target number of MSUs.  The Compensation Committee feels that this approach provides a stronger pay-for-performance alignment and appropriately distinguishes our program from the most common MSU design among our peers, which provides target payments for delivering TSR that simply matches that of the benchmark index or peer group (vs.
requiring 25 points of TSR outperformance).  For more information on the design of our MSU program for awards granted in 2014, see “Long-term Incentives – MSU Awards” below.
Over the past three fiscal years, ~48% of our CEO’s target total direct compensation has been awarded in the form of MSUs.  While we have delivered positive TSR during the relevant performance cycles, as of the end of FY14, given the performance requirements of our MSU awards, our CEO forfeited 100% of the MSUs he was granted in FY12.  These MSUs represented ~72% of his target total direct compensation for FY12.  As of the end of FY 2014, he was on track to earn between 0% and ~28% of the target number of his other outstanding MSUs awards for the relevant performance periods, using the closing price of our common stock on January 2, 2015 of $47.51.
Update on MSU Grants awarded to CEO from FY12 to FY14
Grant
Target Pay—includes base salary, target cash bonus amount, other compensation paid and the “fair value” at grant of equity awards (i.e., the accounting value of RSUs and MSUs).
Realizable pay calculations assume equity awards are 100% vested upon grant, even though all such awards actually vest over three years.
For more information on the various elements of compensation and the design of our MSU program for awards granted in 2014, see “Long-term Incentives – MSU Awards” below.
Role of Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering our executive compensation program, as well as determining and approving the compensation for our Named Executive Officers.
The Compensation Committee regularly reports to our Board of Directors on its deliberations and actions.
The Compensation Committee uses a balanced approach to set the compensation of our executive officers, with each primary direct component of compensation (base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive compensation) designed to play a specific role in achieving this objective.
The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of each executive officer with respect to each compensation component based, in part, on its own analysis of competitive market data and the recommendations of our CEO, both as described below.
The Compensation Committee exercises its own judgment in making its compensation decisions and may accept or reject our CEO’s recommendations.
In addition, the Compensation Committee receives input from its compensation consultant and meets in executive session (without our CEO present) prior to making its final determinations regarding compensation.
Differences in compensation among our executive officers are the result of the Compensation Committee’s exercise of its judgment, following its review of our CEO’s recommendations, its analysis of competitive market data and its consideration of overall Company performance, competitive pressures, business conditions, the value of current equity holdings and the potential financial impact of its compensation decisions.
In determining the compensation of our CEO, the Compensation Committee consults with the other independent members of our Board of Directors, assesses our CEO’s individual performance, and considers competitive market data and the other factors described above.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee works with members of our management, including our CEO.
Typically, our management assists the Compensation Committee by providing information on Company performance and its perspective on compensation matters.
Our CEO generally attends Compensation Committee meetings (except with respect to discussions involving his own compensation).
Typically, our CEO formulates recommendations for the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of our executive officers (except with respect to his own compensation) based on a review of the competitive market data developed by the Compensation Consultant, his performance evaluation of each executive officer and other considerations, including competitive pressures, business conditions, the value of current equity holdings, each individual’s tenure, compensation history, prior experience, distinctive value to the Company, variances in job responsibilities relative to similarly titled executives at other companies, the appropriate mix of compensation components, the Company’s overall performance and the potential financial impact (including dilution and compensation cost) associated with their compensation.
Our CEO conducts this assessment with the assistance of our Vice President of Human Resources.  Our CEO then makes formal recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding adjustments to base salary, annual cash incentive award opportunities and equity awards for our executives (except with respect to his own compensation).
While the Compensation Committee solicits and reviews our CEO’s recommendations and proposals with respect to compensation-related matters, the Compensation Committee only uses these recommendations and proposals as one factor in making its own compensation decisions for our executive officers.
The Compensation Committee is authorized to retain the services of compensation consultants and other advisors from time to time, as it sees fit, in connection with the administration of our executive compensation programs.
The Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm providing executive compensation advisory services (“Compensia”), to provide competitive market data and analysis regarding material elements of compensation, including base salary, cash incentives and equity incentives.
Compensia served at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
With the approval of the Compensation Committee, Compensia also provides our CEO and our Vice President of Human Resources with market data regarding compensation for our executive officers so that our CEO’s compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee are consistent with our compensation philosophy.
The Compensation Committee believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders to ensure that our executive compensation is competitive with that of other companies of similar size and complexity.
At the end of 2013, the Compensation Committee directed Compensia to use data gathered from the 2013 Radford Executive Compensation Survey and publicly-available information from the following companies to identify and analyze the competitive market for executive compensation:
The Compensation Committee does not use a prescribed formula for allocating compensation between annual and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of non-cash compensation.
Annual Cash Incentive Awards.  Each year, the Compensation Committee adopts a bonus plan (the “Bonus Plan”) to reward exceptional performance and align the financial incentives of our Named Executive Officers with our short-term operating plan and long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders.
The Compensation Committee approves the design, structure, and performance objectives, as well as each objective’s relative weighting, under the Bonus Plan.
The Compensation Committee designs the Bonus Plan to pay each executive officer up to 150% of his target annual cash incentive award opportunity for outstanding performance.
Consistent with our “pay-for-performance” philosophy, however, no payment is guaranteed if an executive officer fails to meet the minimum established performance objectives for his award opportunity under the Bonus Plan.  In 2014, the Compensation Committee established a target annual cash incentive award opportunity under the Bonus Plan for each of our Named Executive Officers as a specified percentage of his or her base salary.
Typically, the Compensation Committee establishes one or more corporate financial metrics tied to our annual operating plan as the principal measures for determining each executive officer’s annual cash incentive award.
For 2014, consistent with our business strategy, the Compensation Committee established adjusted revenue and adjusted operating income as a percentage of adjusted revenue as the principal corporate financial metrics.
For purposes of cash incentive awards, the Compensation Committee reserves the authority to determine whether to exclude any item when making adjustments from the corresponding GAAP metric.  To reflect their functional roles and responsibilities, the Compensation Committee established corporate financial metrics as set forth in the table below for the purpose of determining the annual cash incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers.  With respect to each of these corporate financial metrics, the percentage payout was to be determined using a sliding scale based on actual performance, with no minimum payout and a maximum payout of 150% of the portion of the executive’s target annual cash incentive award opportunity for above-target performance.
To ensure a direct correlation between our short-term performance and our actual business results, the Compensation Committee makes quarterly payments to our Named Executive Officers under the Bonus Plan.
Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion either to make payments absent attainment of the relevant performance metric target levels or to reduce or increase the size of any award payment.
Neither the Board of Directors nor the Compensation Committee exercised such discretion in 2014.
The Compensation Committee uses long-term incentive compensation, typically in the form of equity awards, for our Named Executive Officers, to retain talent, to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and to provide incentives that we believe encourage behaviors that will maximize stockholder value.
For 2014, the Compensation Committee approved the use of a mix of MSUs and RSUs.
MSU Awards.  Since 2012 we have awarded MSUs that compare our TSR against the XSOX.  For MSU awards granted after the beginning of our FY 13, a payment equal to the target number of units can only be earned if our TSR exceeds the TSR results of the Index by 25 points.
In 2014, we granted MSUs using the same performance scale as the awards granted in FY13 and shown above, but we also made the following changes to the program terms:
Added a cap on MSU payouts if TSR is negative.  After reviewing best practices, our Compensation Committee introduced a cap on MSU payouts such that in the event our TSR is negative, the maximum payout under the MSUs would be 100% of the target award (regardless of the amount of TSR outperformance relative to the XSOX).  This feature was added to reflect leading best practices in program design and to further strengthen the program from a pay-for-performance and shareholder alignment perspective.
RSU Awards. The RSUs awarded in 2014 provide a retention incentive and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.  These RSUs generally vest as to the underlying shares of common stock in three annual installments on each anniversary of the date of grant.
Grant Date 
Grant 
Generally, the equity awards granted under the Company’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on April 15, 2014, provide for accelerated vesting of any unvested shares in the event that such equity awards are not assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity in connection with a change in control of the Company or the executive officer is demoted, relocated, or terminated other than for misconduct within 18 months following the change in control transaction.
The terms and conditions of these acceleration provisions are provided at a level that the Compensation Committee believes to be comparable to those of companies of similar size in our industry sector.
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits.  In addition to the general welfare benefits described above, the Compensation Committee has determined that we provide our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, with an annual physical examination beyond the benefit provided under our standard health care plans.
The Compensation Committee does not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program and, except as described in the preceding paragraph, did not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers during 2014.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation.  In determining which elements of compensation are to be paid, and how they are weighted, the Compensation Committee takes into account the implications of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 162(m)”).  Generally, Section 162(m) prohibits us from taking a federal income tax deduction for remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to our CEO and each of the other three most highly-compensated executive officers (not including the CFO) of the Company in a taxable year.  Remuneration in excess of $1 million may be deducted if, among other things, it qualifies as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.  In this regard, the compensation income realized upon the exercise of stock options granted under a stockholder-approved stock option plan generally will be deductible so long as the options are granted by a committee whose members are non-employee directors and certain other conditions are satisfied.
The Compensation Committee’s policy is to qualify, to the extent practicable, the compensation of our executive officers for deductibility under applicable tax laws.  The Compensation Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program to meet our stated business objectives, however, and, thus, reserves the right to pay compensation that is not tax-deductible if it determines that such a payment is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
Accounting Treatment of Executive Compensation.  The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (“ASC Topic 718”), formerly known as SFAS 123(R), for our stock-based awards.  ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation cost for all stock-based awards made to employees (including our executive officers) and directors, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the grant date “fair value” of these awards.  This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards.  ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for his or her award.
Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation
We, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis within the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement with the management of the Company.  Based on such review and discussion, we are of the opinion that the executive compensation policies and plans provide appropriate compensation to properly align Silicon Laboratories’ performance and the interests of its stockholders through the use of competitive and equitable executive compensation in a balanced and reasonable manner, for both the short- and long-term.  Accordingly, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included as part of this Proxy filing.
Submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors:
Amounts shown do not reflect compensation actually received by the Named Executive Officer, but represent the grant date fair value as determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718 (disregarding any estimate of forfeitures).  The assumptions underlying the calculation under ASC Topic 718 are discussed under Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015.

The following table shows gains realized from the exercise of stock options and shares acquired upon the vesting of RSUs with respect to our Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2014.
OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED TABLE DURING FISCAL 2014
Exercise
Value Realized on Exercise
At our 2009 annual stockholders’ meeting, our stockholders approved the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”) and the 2009 Plan became effective immediately.  On April 15, 2014, our stockholders approved amendments of the 2009 Plan.  The amendments updated the 2009 Plan to comply with changes in local laws, authorized additional shares of common stock for future issuance, improved the Company’s corporate governance, and implement other best practices.  Under our prior 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2000 Plan”), no shares remain issuable except for those that were subject to outstanding awards as of the date of approval of the 2009 Plan.  The 2009 Plan and the 2000 Plan (together, the “Plans”) govern the equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers and other participants. 
Discretionary Acceleration of Awards:  Our Compensation Committee, as plan administrator of the Plans has the authority to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding equity awards at any time, including in the event of a change in control of the Company, by means of a “hostile take-over” or otherwise, whether or not those awards are assumed or replaced or otherwise continued in effect.  Under the 2000 Plan, any options so accelerated shall remain exercisable until the expiration or sooner termination of the option term in the case of a hostile take-over.
Acceleration Upon Termination After a Change in Control:  During a change in control, our Compensation Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting if a participant (including a Named Executive Officers) is Involuntarily Terminated within a period of 18 months following a change in control.  Pursuant to this authority, the terms of the stock options and stock awards granted to the Named Executive Officers and other participants under the Plans provide for such acceleration in vesting in the event of Involuntary Termination within 18 months following a change in control.  Under the 2000 Plan, any options so accelerated shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) one year from the date of the participant’s termination and (ii) the expiration of the option term in the case of a change of control, and until the expiration or sooner termination of the option term in the case of a hostile take-over.  Involuntary Termination includes termination by the successor company for reasons other than misconduct or resignation by the individual following a material reduction in duties, a greater than 15% reduction in compensation, or involuntary relocation by more than 50 miles.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of our executive officers serves as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee.  No member of the Compensation Committee currently serves as one of our officers or employee.
Exercise of 
Average Exercise 
Includes 2,078,834 shares of common stock subject to full value awards that vest over the holders’ period of continued service and 528,651 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options with a weighted average remaining term of 1.6 years.  Excludes purchase rights accruing under our 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  Under the 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, each eligible employee may contribute up to 15% of his or her base salary to purchase shares of our common stock at semi-annual intervals on the last U.S.

 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
 Equity Grant Practices
 Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022
 Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2022
A shareholder may revoke a proxy, whether submitted via telephone, the Internet or mailed, at any time prior to its exercise by filing with Pediatrix’s Secretary a duly executed revocation of proxy, by properly submitting, either by telephone, mail or Internet, a proxy to Pediatrix’s Secretary bearing a later date or by appearing at the meeting and voting online.
The Board of Directors elected to exercise direct oversight over this area, rather than acting through one of the committees, given the increasing importance of such matters and the cross-functional impacts of technology on the Company’s business.
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  In 2022, none of our executive officers or Directors was a member of the Board of Directors of any other company where the relationship would be considered a compensation committee interlock under the SEC rules.
 • In 2021, shareholders overwhelmingly expressed their support for the changes to our executive compensation program, including the target compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, the use of non-financial metrics in the annual bonus program and the elimination of off-cycle equity grants and bonuses.
For equity-based awards, we believe that our share price should ultimately reflect whether we have executed this strategy successfully and the three-year back end weighted vesting schedule (with half of the award vesting in year three) for equity grants ensures that our officers maintain a long-term perspective.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION: COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (“CD&A”)      CEO Pay At-A-Glance  Over half of the target direct compensation (sum of base salary, target bonus and grant value of stock awards, including performance shares at target) of Dr. James D.
When determining salaries, target bonus opportunities and annual equity grants for NEOs, the Compensation and Talent Committee also considers the performance of the Company and the individual, the nature of an individual’s role within the Company, internal comparisons to the compensation of other Company officers, tenure with the Company and experience in the officer’s current role.
The Compensation and Talent Committee uses guidelines and may apply either positive or negative discretion to adjust the bonuses based on the actual level of income from operations achieved, as well as other performance goals established for individual NEOs.
Equity-Based Awards  2022 Equity-Based Awards  The Compensation and Talent Committee approved the annual equity-based awards outlined below in February 2022 with a March 1, 2022 grant date for the then-current NEOs, Messrs.
50% of the equity-based awards for 2022 were granted in performance shares that:   
The Compensation and Talent Committee, working with its independent compensation consultant and Company management, evaluated the impact of various drivers on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in determining the 2022 grants.
While this discussion of 2022 equity awards relates to performance targets for the 2022 performance period, we believe our approach to granting performance shares also creates long-term alignment, given that the value of the award realized by the NEOs will depend on the value of our stock when the shares vest over a multi-year period, with half of the performance shares vesting in the third year, as opposed to prior year grants where one-third of the performance shares vest in the third year.
  • If shares are earned during this initial measurement period, they will vest at the rate of one-quarter per year over the first two anniversaries of the grant date (March 1, 2023 and March 1, 2024) and one-half on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 1, 2025), subject to continued employment.
 • Shares will vest at the rate of one-quarter per year over the first two anniversaries of the grant date (March 1, 2023 and March 1, 2024) and one-half on the third anniversary of the grant date (March 1, 2025) subject to continued employment.
Other Practices, Policies & Guidelines  Equity Grant Practices  The Compensation and Talent Committee determines the effective date of annual equity-based awards without regard to current or anticipated stock price levels.
The Compensation and Talent Committee made the 2022 annual equity grant to named executive officers in March 2022 and may also make, and in the past has made, grants during the course of the year, primarily for new hires, promotions, to retain valued employees or to reward exceptional performance.
These grants may be subject to performance conditions and/or time-based vesting and are issued on the date of grant approval or upon a date certain following the grant approval date.
The Compensation and Talent Committee does not plan to grant off-cycle awards to any executive officers of the Company unless it is part of their initial hiring process.
We follow equity grant procedures designed to promote the proper authorization, documentation and accounting for all equity grants.
Pursuant to these procedures the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors must formally approve all equity awards during an in person or telephonic meeting or by the unanimous written consent executed by all members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, it being understood that no equity award granted pursuant to any such written consent may have an effective date earlier than the date that all executed counterparts of such unanimous written consent are delivered to the General Counsel of the Company.
The grant-date fair value of our equity-based awards will be the closing sales price for a share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the effective date of the grant as approved by the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors, which date may not be prior to either the date such grant was approved or the commencement date of employment of the employee to whom the equity award is being made.
The policy also requires NEOs to retain 50% of net after-tax shares acquired during the year upon vesting (or exercise of stock options) unless his or her ownership level was satisfied as of the beginning of the year.
Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans  We maintain a Thrift and Profit Sharing Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), which is a 401(k) plan, to enable eligible employees to save for retirement through a tax-advantaged combination of elective employee contributions and our discretionary matching contributions and provide employees the 
Matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan are discretionary.
The amounts in this column reflect the grant-date fair value of the awards, calculated in accordance with the accounting guidance for equity-based compensation, but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures.
The amounts included for any performance-based restricted stock awards are calculated based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions for such awards on the grant date.
See the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 table for information on restricted stock awards granted in 2022.
The amounts in this column reflect the grant-date fair value of the awards, calculated in accordance with the accounting guidance for equity-based compensation, but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures.
For 2020, additional compensation also includes $250,000 for a discretionary bonus and $16,009 for Mr. Andreano’s share of personal travel on an aircraft which Pediatrix previously leased.

 The vesting of the performance nonqualified stock option awards is contingent upon the satisfaction of one year of continuous service and the achievement of various stock price hurdles before the third anniversary of the grant date, which were achieved in 2021.
Ordan and Andreano and the severance and other termination benefits paid to each of them was in accordance with their respective Employment Agreements and no discretionary severance amounts were paid.
The Employment Agreement for Mr. Ordan provided that, in the event Mr. Ordan’s employment was terminated due to Disability or death, by the Company without Cause (which occurred effective December 31, 2022), or by Mr. Ordan for Good Reason, the time-based portion of the equity awards granted to Mr. Ordan would immediately become fully vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable, and all performance based share awards would remain outstanding and vest based upon actual performance determined at the end of the applicable performance period.
Further, in the event Mr. Richards, Ms. Moore or Dr. Swift’s employment is terminated due to Disability or death, any time-based equity awards granted to the executive prior to termination of his or her employment will immediately become fully vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable, and all performance-based shares awards will remain outstanding and vest based upon actual performance determined at the end of the applicable performance period.
In addition, in the event of a Change of Control, (i) all time-based equity awards granted to Mr. Richards, Ms. Moore or Dr. Swift will immediately become fully vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable and (ii) all performance-based equity awards granted to such executives for which the applicable performance condition has been met at the time of such Change in Control will immediately become fully vested, non-forfeitable and, if applicable, exercisable.

As shown in these tables, the Compensation “Actually Paid” totals represent the SCT totals for the applicable year, but adjusted as required by SEC rules to include the fair value of current and prior year equity awards that are outstanding, vested or forfeited during the applicable year, instead of the grant date value of awards granted during the applicable year.
Unlike the SCT, which reflects the grant date fair value of equity awards granted during the applicable year, the CAP table reflects equity fair value as follows:  
for awards granted during the applicable year (and which are still outstanding), the year-end value; plus  
for awards granted during prior years that were still outstanding as of the applicable year-end, the change in value as of the applicable year-end compared against the prior year-end; plus  
for awards granted in prior years that vested during the applicable year, the change in value as of the vesting date compared against the prior year-end; plus  
for any awards granted in the applicable year that vested during the applicable year, the value as of the vesting date; plus  
for awards granted in prior years that were forfeited during the applicable year, the value as of the prior year-end.
In addition, the Company recently began granting performance-based equity awards with three one-year performance periods and a three-year return on invested capital modifier.

It depends on whether your shares are registered directly in your own name or are held on your behalf in street name by a brokerage firm, bank or trust.  If you are a registered Shareholder holding your shares directly in your own name, your shares will NOT be voted unless you provide a Proxy or vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  In the case of shares held in street name, brokerage firms generally have the authority to vote their clients' unvoted shares in their discretion on certain routine matters.  For example, if your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm and you do not provide voting instructions, that firm can vote your shares with respect to the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors (Proposal 2), as this matter is considered routine under the applicable New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") rules.  All other matters to be voted on at this year's Annual Meeting are not considered routine, and your broker voting on a routine matter cannot vote your shares on those non-routine matters without your instruction (""broker non-votes"").

(2)  The annual grant of Company Common Stock for 2016 consisted of $120,000 of Company Common Stock under the Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and was paid on a quarterly basis.  The number of shares paid each quarter is determined based on the average of the closing market price of the Company's Common Stock on each of the second through sixth business days following the date on which the Company publicly released its quarterly results.
Directors who are also employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for service as Directors.  In 2017, Directors who are not employees of the Company will receive annual cash base fees, grants of Company Common Stock and cash committee fees in the amounts set forth as follows.

Compensation Committee.  In 2016, the Compensation Committee had two meetings.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for the review of the executive compensation program.  The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs.
Löliger serves as Chairperson of the Compensation Committee.  For further discussion regarding the Compensation Committee's processes and procedures for the consideration of executive compensation, see ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis.""
2016 Say-on-Pay Vote Results.  At our Annual Meeting of Shareholders held in April 2016, we held a non-binding Shareholder Say-on-Pay vote on the 2015 compensation of our NEOs.  Over 90% of the shares voted at last year's Annual Meeting voted FOR our Say-on-Pay resolution, approving the compensation of our NEOs.  The Board's Compensation Committee (the ""Committee"") believes the results of the Say-on-Pay vote show strong support for the performance-based and ownership-oriented compensation philosophy that the Committee has utilized.  Accordingly, the Committee did not change its general approach to executive compensation in 2016, although the Committee has made changes to the short-term and long-term compensation programs, effective in 2017, as noted below.  Although the advisory Shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Committee will continue to take the outcome of this annual vote into consideration when making compensation decisions for our NEOs.
 Engage an independent compensation consultant for our Compensation Committee
 Use individual qualitative factors in determining executives' annual cash bonuses
In 2015 our NEOs forfeited 28% of their 2012 performance-based equity grants.
In 2016 they forfeited 63% of their 2013 performance-based equity grants.
In 2017 they forfeited 34% of their 2014 performance-based equity grants.
In particular, the Company's CEO forfeited 42% of the aggregate grant-date fair value of performance shares granted him in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and this resulted in forfeiture of 19% of the CEO's aggregate total direct compensation for those three years.
Role of the Compensation Committee.  The Committee currently comprises four Non-Employee Directors, all of whom are independent under the NYSE listing standards.  During 2016, the Committee members were Hans Löliger (Chairperson), Arnold Donald, William Little and Jim Turner.  The Committee has responsibility for determining and implementing the Company's philosophy with respect to executive compensation.  To implement this philosophy, the Committee oversees the establishment and administration of the Company's executive compensation program.  The Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.
growth and Shareholder value, and approximately two-thirds of the value of the restricted stock granted in 2016 under the Company's long-term incentive plan is tied to performance of the Company's total shareholder return versus that of a peer group.  In addition, beginning in 2017, the Company's long-term incentive plan will also be tied to the Company's return on invested capital, as a second metric.
Until the ownership requirement is satisfied, an NEO is required to retain 50% of the after-tax value of any Common Stock received as the result of an option exercise or vesting of restricted shares.  At year-end, all the NEOs either owned more than the minimum level of Common Stock or were otherwise in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.
Retention of Compensation Consultants.  The Committee's charter authorizes the Committee, in its sole discretion, to retain and terminate consultants to assist it in the evaluation of compensation for the NEOs.  The Committee has sole authority to approve the fees and other retention terms of any such consultant.
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions.  The Committee makes all decisions regarding the CEO's compensation.  Decisions regarding the compensation of other NEOs are made by the Committee in consultation with, and upon the recommendation of, the CEO.  In this regard, the CEO provides the Committee evaluations of business goals and objectives and executive performance and recommendations regarding salary levels, equity grants and other incentive awards.
Consultant Independence.  All services provided by Pay Governance to the Committee are conducted under the direction and authority of the Committee, and all work performed by Pay Governance must be pre-approved by the Committee.  Pay Governance does not provide any other services to the Company, and neither Pay Governance nor the individuals who provide services to the Company owns any shares of the Company's stock.  There are no personal or business relationships between the Pay Governance consultants and any executive of the Company.  In addition, there are no personal relationships between the Pay Governance consultants and any member of the Committee.  Pay Governance maintains a detailed conflict of interest policy in order to ensure that compensation committees receive conflict-free advice.
Annual Incentive Bonus.  Annual cash bonuses are included as part of the executive compensation program because, consistent with our ""pay-for-performance"" philosophy, the Committee believes that a significant portion of each NEO's compensation should be contingent on success in achieving annual goals that drive the long-term operating performance of the Company.
Our NEOs are eligible for annual cash bonuses under our shareholder-approved 2015 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the ""AIB Plan"").  For 2016, our NEOs were eligible to receive annual incentive bonuses under the AIB Plan upon the achievement of specified levels of economic profit and modified operating cash flow.
Weighting of Performance Measures.  At the beginning of 2016, the Committee determined target levels of performance for each performance measure.  At year-end, the Committee assessed the actual results versus the original goals in determining awards.  The Committee must approve all awards, and all awards are subject to review and downward discretionary adjustment by the Committee.
Long-Term Equity Incentives.  The Committee believes that equity-based incentives, delivered through annual grants of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock, are an important link between executive and Shareholder interests.  Because the Committee believes that a significant portion of the benefits realized from long-term equity-based incentive grants should require continuous improvement in value created for the Shareholders, approximately two-thirds of the targeted value of stock awards to NEOs is performance-based.  In 2016 and earlier periods, the Company used total shareholder return as the single performance metric for purposes of awarding performance-based shares.  However, beginning in 2017, the Committee approved the use of return on invested capital as a second performance metric in awarding performance-based shares.  The Committee believes that the use of this second metric will better align the Company's long-term incentive plan with its peers, with current market practice and with the expectations of  Shareholders.  Although the Committee may vary the size of annual grants based on the Company's and executive's performance, the total annual equity award granted to each NEO is generally determined based upon the difference between the total direct compensation target established by the Committee, using the competitive market benchmarking and internal factors described above, and the sum of the NEO's base salary and annual incentive bonus opportunity.  See ""Compensation Strategy for CEO"" and ""Compensation Strategy for NEOs other than the CEO.""  In addition to the annual equity awards, the Committee may approve equity awards for newly hired executives or in recognition of an executive's promotion or expansion of responsibilities.
Performance-Based Restricted Stock.  Approximately two-thirds of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive was delivered in performance-based restricted stock that may be earned based upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to a group of industry peers over a three-year performance period.  A target number of shares was established for 2016 for each NEO, as set forth in the ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards"" table below.  Actual vesting of performance-based share awards generally will not occur until the third anniversary of the grant date, if at all.  The Committee believes that, in addition to linking a substantial portion of our NEOs' compensation to the long-term performance of the Company, the three-year vesting structure provides a strong retention element because an NEO terminating employment (other than for retirement with Committee approval, disability or death) will leave behind unvested awards.
Time-Based Restricted Stock.  Approximately one-third of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive was delivered in time-based restricted stock that vests in equal annual installments over three years from the date of the award in the amounts set forth on the ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards"" table below.
Industry Peer Group Composition.  The Committee believes that for purposes of comparing shareholder returns it is appropriate to utilize a recognized publicly available index of container and packaging industry companies as the peer group.  As a result, with respect to determining shareholder return for 2016 grants, the Committee will use the Dow Jones ""U.S.
As set forth above in ""Pay-for-Performance Alignment,"" NEOs forfeited performance-based shares granted in each of the last three years:
Therefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2015 pursuant to the 2012 grant were vested at the 72% level, and 28% of the award was forfeited.
Therefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2016 pursuant to the 2013 grant were vested at the 37% level, and 63% of the award was forfeited.
The number of performance-based shares from the 2013 grant in which each NEO vested in 2016 based on the Company's stock performance for the three-year calendar period ended December 31, 2015 are set forth below in the ""Option Exercises and Stock Vested"" table.
The Company's total shareholder return for the three-year calendar period ended December 31, 2016 was 18% based upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on that date (i.e., $52.57 per share) compared to the closing price on December 31, 2013 (i.e., $44.57 per share).  When compared, however, to the total shareholder return of the other companies in the industry peer group at the time of the 2014 performance-based share award, the Company ranked at the 43rd percentile.  Therefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2017 pursuant to the 2014 grant were vested at the 66% level, and 34% of the award was forfeited.  Performance-based shares from the 2014 grant did not vest until January 2017 and, therefore, will be set forth in the ""Option Exercises and Stock Vested"" table in next year's Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding consistent positive shareholder return totaling 57% over the 2012 to 2016 time period that comprised the cumulative performance period for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 performance share grants, the Company's CEO at the time of the grants nevertheless forfeited 42% of the aggregate grant-date fair value of performance shares granted him in 2012, 2013 and 2014.  This forfeiture, representing 19% of the CEO's aggregate total direct compensation for those three years, exemplifies the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.
2016 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards.  The following table sets forth the target number of time-based and performance-based restricted shares granted to the NEOs for 2016 as well as the minimum and maximum number of performance-based shares that may vest based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to the industry peer group over the applicable performance period.  The table also sets forth the fair value of the shares on the date of grant based on a share price of $48.47 for time-based restricted stock and $51.05 for performance-based restricted stock (based on a Monte Carlo valuation model) for all NEOs with the exception of Robert Bourque.  Mr.
Bourque was granted shares when he was promoted to President of the Asia Pacific Division in May 2016.  The fair value on the date of grant was $53.87 per share for time-based restricted stock and $55.95 per share for performance-based restricted stock.
Pension Plan described above, the Company provides additional retirement benefits to the NEOs under the Senior Executive Retirement Plan (""SERP"").  The annual benefit for executives eligible to participate in the SERP is based upon a formula equal to (i) 2.0% of the average of the five highest consecutive years of earnings (consisting of salary and bonus, but excluding stock compensation, and determined without regard to the limits imposed on tax-qualified plans) during the last 10 years of employment times years of service up to twenty years plus (ii) 1.45% of such earnings for the next fifteen years plus (iii) at the discretion of the Committee, 1% of such earnings for years of service beyond thirty-five years less (iv) Social Security old-age benefits (and similar benefits provided in foreign jurisdictions) attributable to employment with the Company and the Company-funded portion of the executive's Pension Plan benefits.  In the case of Mr.
In addition, under the AIB Plan, the Committee has structured annual incentive bonuses that also qualify for this exemption.  However, the Committee believes that Shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards result in non-deductible compensation expenses.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with the Company's management.  Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.
This report is respectfully submitted on February 22, 2017 by the members of the Compensation Committee.
The amounts in this column, computed in accordance with current Financial Accounting Standard Board guidance for accounting for and reporting of stock-based compensation, represent the aggregate grant-date fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock (market condition) awards issued by the Company for the respective fiscal years.  The grant-date fair market values of the time-based restricted stock awards were as follows:  Mr.
Bourque:  $103,484 for 2016.  The grant-date fair market values of the performance-based restricted stock, assuming instead that the highest level of performance conditions were to be achieved, would be as follows:  Mr.
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table provides information about the annual incentive bonuses that the Company's NEOs were eligible to receive in 2016 under the Company's 2015 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan and stock-based awards granted in 2016 to each of the Company's NEOs under the Company's 2013 Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan.  There can be no assurance that the fair value of the performance-based stock awarded to the Company's NEOs in 2016 will ever be realized by the NEOs.  For further information and the assumptions made in determining the grant-date fair values of the stock awards, see Notes A and P to the Company's financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
Grant Dates of Equity Awards
2016 Grant
The performance measures are based upon the Company's total shareholder return (""TSR"") versus the TSR of a defined peer group of companies that are described in ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Equity Incentives"" above.  The vesting of the performance-based shares from the 2016 award will occur in January 2019, with the actual number of shares vesting dependent upon the Company's TSR compared to that of the peer group.  For further details, refer to Note P, ""Stock-Based Compensation"" to the Company's financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  Rights to the performance-based shares are not forfeited upon death or disability and remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.  Performance-based shares may not be forfeited upon retirement at the discretion of the Committee and, if not forfeited, remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.  Performance-based shares vest upon a ""change in control"" of the Company based upon the Company's TSR as compared to that of the peer group at the time of the ""change in control.""
These amounts represent the grant-date fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awarded in 2016.  The grant-date fair value of the time-based restricted stock is the $48.47 per share closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the award for all NEOs except Mr.
Bourque.  The grant-date fair value of the performance-based shares is $51.05, except for Mr.
Bourque's award, the grant-date fair value of the time-based restricted stock is the $53.87 per share closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the award.  The grant-date fair value of the performance-based shares is $55.95 and is based on a Monte Carlo valuation model.  The Committee has determined that approximately two-thirds of the targeted value of stock awards to NEOs should be performance-based.  In order for the Company in 2016 to deliver two-thirds of the value of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive in performance-based restricted stock, somewhat more than one-third of the total number of shares granted were time-based restricted shares, and somewhat less than two-thirds were performance-based restricted shares because the prescribed valuation methods under FASB ASC Topic 718 result in higher per unit values for performance-based restricted stock than for time-based restricted stock.

Kelly's 40,000 unexercised exercisable options reported under this column were exercised on February 10, 2017.
These amounts represent outstanding unvested performance-based restricted stock at target levels.  The range of shares to be received is 0 to 200% of the target based on the levels of performance achieved under the 2014 award from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, under the 2015 award from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, and under the 2016 award from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.  The number reported does not include any additional shares that may be awarded based upon the Company's performance but does include shares that may be forfeited based on the Company's performance.  The vesting date for the performance-based shares awarded in 2014 was January 3, 2017.  For information relating to the 2017 performance-based share vesting, see ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Equity Incentives.""  Rights to the performance-based shares are not forfeited upon death or disability and remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.  Performance-based shares may not be forfeited upon retirement at the discretion of the Committee and, if not forfeited, remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.  Performance-based shares vest upon a ""change in control"" of the Company based upon the Company's TSR as compared to that of the peer group at the time of the ""change in control.""

The following table shows the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock acquired and the actual value received during 2016 upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of stock awards.

The annual benefit for the NEOs under the SERP is based upon a formula equal to (i) 2.0% of the average of the five highest consecutive years of earnings during the last 10 years of service (consisting of salary and bonus, but excluding stock compensation, and determined without regard to the limits imposed on tax-qualified plans) times years of service up to twenty years plus (ii) 1.45% of such earnings for the next fifteen years plus (iii) at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, 1% of such earnings for years of service beyond thirty-five years less (iv) Social Security old-age benefits (and similar benefits provided in foreign jurisdictions) attributable to employment with the Company and the Company-funded portion of the executive's Pension Plan benefits.  In the case of Mr.
In addition, all stock options and time-based and performance-based restricted stock granted to such executives by the Company will become fully vested and, in the case of stock options, immediately exercisable.  In all such cases, the Company will also pay to the executive any vested retirement, incentive or other benefits.  To the extent that the executive would be subject to the excise tax under Code Section 4999 on the amounts and benefits received on a Change in Control for purposes of Code Section 280G, either (i) such amounts and benefits will be reduced or delayed by the minimum amount necessary such that no portion of the amount or benefits is subject to the excise tax or (ii) the full amount and benefits shall be paid, whichever, after taking into account all applicable taxes, including the excise tax, results in the executive's receipt, or an after-tax basis, of the greater amount and benefits.
Although the vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee.  However, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by Shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions regarding the frequency of conducting a Say-on-Pay vote.

Human Resources and Compensation Committee Report
The members of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Scholastic Corporation have provided this report.
The Company’s compensation programs for its executive officers and other senior management are administered by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (“HRCC”), which is composed solely of independent directors as defined by NASDAQ rules.
Cash bonuses to be paid to each Named Executive Officer receiving a bonus for fiscal 2021 under the redesigned MIP are as follows:
The HRCC determines the awards of long-term incentive compensation through equity incentives in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based stock units granted to executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, and senior management, as well as certain other eligible employees.
Annual equity grants to key employees, including the Named Executive Officers and other members of senior management, at its regularly scheduled meeting in September.
Such grants currently vest 331/3% each year over a three year period, with the stock option grants having a seven year exercise period.
Equity grants at other times depending upon circumstances such as promotions, new hires or special considerations.
In the case of fiscal 2021, as referred to under “Fiscal 2021 MIP Plan Design and Bonuses” on page 14 above, the HRCC, in lieu of merit increases to all employees at the manager level and above, determined to grant equity-based awards to such employees, including the Named Executive Officers and other members of senior management, with cash bonuses, being limited to the MIP contingency pool as described.
The Company currently makes its grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards under the Scholastic Corporation 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), which was approved by the Board in July 2011 and by the Class A Stockholders in September 2011.
It is intended that grants in respect to fiscal 2022 will be considered by the HRCC under the Scholastic Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive Plan beginning with its meeting to 
Accordingly, in years in which annual equity grants are made, the Company currently intends to utilize grants of stock options, restricted stock units and, on a limited basis, performance stock units, or a combination thereof, to qualified executives, including the Named Executive Officers.
As indicated above, during fiscal 2021, the HRCC granted equity-based awards to certain of the Named Executive Officers and other members of senior management in the context of the redesigned MIP, as well as making a general grant to employees in lieu of merit increases.
Pursuant to its customary practice, grants were also made to certain newly-hired or promoted employees to fulfill contractual obligations or commitments.
These grants were made in the form of stock options, restricted stock units or a combination of both.
The proposed 2021 Stock Incentive Plan, as discussed under Proposal 2 “Approval of the Scholastic Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive Plan,” set forth herein, does not permit the deferral of restricted stock units, and the vesting of restricted stock units which may be awarded thereunder is anticipated to be in either three or four equal annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant.
The specific fiscal 2021 grants to the Named Executive Officers are set forth below in the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” table, and information regarding the equity awards held by the Named Executive Officers as of the end of fiscal 2021 is set forth below in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at May 31, 2021” table.
It is intended that any such grants to be considered by the HRCC at its meeting to be held in September 2021 will be effective following the vote of the Class A Stockholders on Proposal 2 set forth herein.

Bedi was entitled to exercise any stock options then held by him for a period of ninety days after his termination.
Under the MSPP, which was adopted in 1999 in order to provide an additional incentive for senior management, including the Named Executive Officers, to invest in Common Stock through the use of their cash bonuses paid under the MIP, eligible members of senior management may use such annual cash bonus payments on a tax-deferred basis to purchase restricted stock units (“RSUs”) in the Company at a 25% discount from the lowest closing price as reported on NASDAQ in the fiscal quarter in which the bonus is paid.

Accordingly, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to benefits upon termination of their employment or a change-in-control only as provided for in respect of stock options and restricted stock units previously granted the 2011 Plan and previously purchased RSUs under the MSPP specifically negotiated arrangements.
Because the HRCC (which administers each of these plans) has this power and may, in its discretion, choose to exercise such power in connection with a change-in-control or similar event (such as a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity or the acquisition of the Company’s Common Stock by a single person or group), the Company has presented information in the table on page 30 below regarding potential pay-outs to the Named Executive Officers upon a change-in-control based on the assumption that the HRCC would use its authority to accelerate vesting of restricted stock units and stock options and convert restricted stock units to shares under these plans effective upon a change-in-control of the Company.

Except in limited circumstances, other than in connection with grants being made to new hires, the HRCC does not generally grant equity awards to Named Executive Officers at other times during a given year and, in such cases, the grants would normally be made by the HRCC at one of its other regularly scheduled meetings.
All equity awards are made at fair market value on the date of grant, which is no earlier than the date on which the HRCC approves the grant.
Under the 2011 Plan, fair market value is deemed to be the average of the high and low market prices of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
The HRCC has the authority and discretion to retain such external compensation consultants as it deems appropriate.

Upon the recommendation of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the “HRCC”), the Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is submitting to the holders of the Class A Stock, for their consideration and approval, the Scholastic Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”).
The 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”), which will expire on September 21, 2021, is the only plan under which equity awards may be granted to the Company’s employees and consultants.
Stock options and restricted stock units have historically been the Company’s principal form of long-term incentive compensation and have been granted as a means to motivate superior performance and to link directly the economic interests of executives and other key employees with those of stockholders.
The 2021 Plan also permits similar stock-based awards to be granted under certain conditions in foreign jurisdictions.
The Committee will have the full authority and discretion to administer and interpret the 2021 Plan, including the authority: (i) to grant discretionary awards under the 2021 Plan, (ii) to determine the persons to whom discretionary awards will be granted, (iii) to determine the types of discretionary awards to be granted, which must be either non-qualified stock options or restricted stock units, (iv) to determine the terms and conditions of each discretionary award, (v) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each discretionary award, (vi) to prescribe the form or forms of instruments evidencing awards, and (vii) to make all other determinations and interpretations in connection with the 2021 Plan and awards made thereunder as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable.
The Committee may also, in its discretion, extend or accelerate the exercisability of an award granted under the 2021 Plan, accelerate the vesting of or eliminate or make less restrictive any restrictions contained in any award, waive any restriction or other provision of the 2021 Plan or of any award or otherwise amend or modify any award in any manner that is not adverse to the participant to whom the award was granted.
Awards under the 2021 Plan may not be made on or after September 22, 2031, the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan in expected to be approved by the holders of the Class A Stock of the Company, but awards granted prior to such date may extend beyond that date.
Pursuant to the 2021 Plan, all employees of, and consultants to, the Company or any of its affiliates are eligible to be granted non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units, if so determined by the Committee.
The Committee may award restricted stock units, which are grants of units that, upon vesting, are settled by delivery of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock or as otherwise determined by the Committee.
Dividend equivalent units may be awarded in the discretion of the Committee.
If the grant by the Committee of restricted stock units is based on the attainment of performance goals, the Committee will establish for each recipient the applicable performance goals, formulae or standards and the applicable vesting percentages with reference to the attainment of such goals or satisfaction of such formulas or standards while the outcome of the performance goals are substantially uncertain.
Although awards will generally be nontransferable (except by will or the laws of descent and distribution), the Committee may determine, at the time of grant or thereafter, that a stock option that is otherwise nontransferable will be transferable in whole or in 
The rules concerning the federal income tax consequences with respect to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2021 Plan are quite technical.
In general, a recipient will not realize any taxable income upon the grant of a restricted stock unit and the Company will not receive a deduction at the time of grant.
Because of the flexibility that the 2021 Plan provides, the cost of the 2021 Plan will vary depending on the terms of the individual grants awarded to employees.
In addition, the allocation of awards under the 2021 Plan is not currently determinable since such allocation is dependent upon future decisions to be made by the Committee in its sole discretion, subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan.
For comparison purposes, please refer to the stock option awards under the Company’s 2011 Plan in fiscal 2021, shown in the table titled “Grants of Plan-Based Awards” on page 24 herein.
In addition to the grants shown in that table, in fiscal 2021, 251,787 stock options were granted to other members of senior management as a group and 1,858,029 stock 
options were granted to all other employees.
As a result of Covid-19 and its impact on the Company, a special one-time grant of stock options was made to the Company’s manager-level and employees above in lieu of merit increases during fiscal 2021 and is not reflective of expected future grant patterns under the 2021 Plan.
The Scholastic Corporation 2017 Outside Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock options to non-employee directors.
Grants to non-employee directors are more fully described herein under the caption “Director’s Compensation.” 
2.6“CAUSE” means, with respect to the Termination of Employment of an employee or Termination of Consultancy of a Consultant, (i) in the case where there is no employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of the relevant grant or where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement in effect at such time, but such agreement does not define “cause” (or words of like import), termination due to a Participant’s dishonesty, fraud, insubordination, willful 
misconduct, refusal to perform services (for any reason other than illness or incapacity) or materially unsatisfactory performance of his or her duties for the Company or an Affiliate, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (ii) in the case where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of grant that defines “cause” (or words of like import), termination that is or would be deemed to be “for cause” (or words of like import) as defined under such employment agreement or consultancy agreement at the time of grant, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

2.12“DISABILITY” means (i) in the case where there is no employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of the relevant grant, or where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement in effect at such time, but such agreement does not define “disability”, “total and permanent disability”, as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; (ii) in the case where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant at the time of the relevant grant that defines “disability”, “disability” as defined under such employment agreement or consultancy agreement, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (iii) in the case of an Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code (“Section 409A Award”), “disability” as defined in Section 409A(2)(C) of the Code.

3.1THE COMMITTEE.  The Plan shall be administered and interpreted by the Committee.  If for any reason the appointed Committee does not meet the “non-employee director” or “outside director” requirements of Rule 16b-3, such noncompliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 shall not affect the validity of Awards, grants, interpretations or other actions of the Committee.

(h)to modify, extend or renew an Award, subject to Articles X and XIV herein, provided, however, that if an Award is modified, extended or renewed and thereby deemed to be the issuance of a new Award under the Code or the applicable accounting rules, the grant price of an Award may continue to be the original grant price even if less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time of such modification, extension or renewal; 
(i)to offer to buy out an Option previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time such offer is made;  
(j)to delegate the day-to-day administration of the Plan to one or more officers of the Company or one or more agents, and such administrators may have the authority to execute and distribute agreements or other documents evidencing or relating to Awards granted under the Plan, to maintain Plan administration records, to interpret the terms of Awards and to take such other actions as the Committee may specify.  Any action taken by any such administrator within the scope of its delegation shall be deemed for all purposes to have been taken by the Committee, and references in this Plan to the Committee shall include any such administrator; provided that the actions and interpretations of any such administrator shall be subject to review and approval, disapproval or modification by the Committee; and
3.3GUIDELINES.  Subject to Articles X and XIV hereof, the Committee shall have the discretionary authority to adopt, alter, repeal and interpret and construe such administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing this Plan and perform all acts, including the delegation of its administrative responsibilities, as it shall, from time to time, deem advisable; to construe and interpret the terms and provisions of this Plan and any Award issued under this Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of this Plan.
3.4DECISIONS FINAL.  Any decision, interpretation or other action made or taken in good faith by or at the direction of the Company, the Board or the Committee (or any of its members) arising out of or in connection with this Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of all and each of them, as the case may be, and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all employees and Participants and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns and any persons claiming rights under this Plan or an Award.  A Participant or other person claiming rights under this Plan may contest a decision or action by the Committee with respect to an Award or such other person only on the ground that such decision or action was arbitrary or capricious or was unlawful, and any review of such decision or action by the Board or otherwise shall be limited to determining whether the Committee’s decision or action was arbitrary, capricious or unlawful.
(a)The Committee may designate employees of the Company and Affiliates and professional advisors to assist the Committee in the administration of this Plan and may grant authority to officers to execute Award Agreements or other communications (including by electronic signature or electronic acceptance) or other documents on behalf of the Committee.
liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to this Plan or any Award granted under it.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company (or if applicable, of an Affiliate), each officer and member or former member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company (or if applicable, an Affiliate) against any cost or expense (including reasonable fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Company), and shall be advanced amounts necessary to pay the foregoing at the earliest time and to the fullest extent permitted, arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with this Plan, except to the extent arising out of such officer’s, member’s or former member’s own fraud or bad faith.
Such indemnification shall be in addition to any rights of indemnification the officers, directors or members or former officers, directors or members may have under applicable law or under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any Affiliate.  Notwithstanding anything else herein, this indemnification will not apply to the actions or determinations made by an individual with regard to Awards granted to him or her under this Plan.
4.1SHARES.  The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued or used for reference purposes under this Plan or with respect to which Awards may be granted shall not exceed 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2) with respect to all types of Awards.  The shares of Common Stock available under this Plan may be either authorized and unissued Common Stock or Common Stock held in or acquired for the treasury of the Company.  If any Stock Option granted under this Plan expires, terminates, or is canceled for any reason without having been exercised in full or, with respect to Stock Options, the Company repurchases any Stock Option, the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such unexercised or repurchased Stock Option shall again be available for the purposes of Awards under this Plan.  If Common Stock has been delivered or exchanged by a Participant as full or partial payment to the Company of a grant price or the price of the purchase of an Award, the number of shares of Common Stock exchanged as payment in connection with the exercise or purchase shall again be available for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards.  If Common Stock has been delivered by a Participant for payment of withholding taxes, or if the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable has been reduced for payment of withholding taxes, the number of shares of Common Stock delivered by such Participant or reduced for payment of withholding taxes shall again be available for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards.  
(a)The existence of this Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company’s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company or any Affiliate, any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead 
(b)Subject to the provisions of Section 4.2(d), in the event of any change in the capital structure of the Company by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of shares, recapitalization, or other change in the capital structure of the Company, non-cash distribution with respect to its outstanding Common Stock or capital stock other than Common Stock, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization, partial or complete liquidation, issuance of rights or warrants to purchase any Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock, or any other corporate transaction or event having an effect similar to any of the foregoing, then the aggregate number and kind of shares which thereafter may be issued under this Plan, the number and kind of shares or other property (including cash) to be issued upon exercise of an outstanding Stock Option or other Award granted under this Plan and the purchase price thereof may be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as, and to the extent that, the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement (as determined by the Committee) of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under this Plan, and any such adjustment determined by the Committee in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and employees and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
(c)Fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from any adjustment in Stock Options or other Awards pursuant to Section 4.2(b) shall be aggregated until, and eliminated at, the time of exercise by rounding-down for fractions less than one-half and rounding-up for fractions equal to or greater than one-half.  No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.  
(d)In the event of a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity or in the event of any transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (all of the foregoing being referred to as “Acquisition Events”), each outstanding Award will be treated as the Committee determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without a Participant’s consent, including, without limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or successor entity (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant’s Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such Acquisition Event; (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such Acquisition Event, and, to the extent the Committee determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Acquisition Event; (iv) (A) the termination of an Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award 
or realization of the Participant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Committee determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing.  In taking any of the actions permitted under this Section 4.2(d), the Committee will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, similarly.  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2(d) to the contrary, prior to any payment or adjustment contemplated under this Section 4.2(d), the Committee may require a Participant to  bear such Participant’s pro rata share of any post-closing indemnity obligations and be subject to the same post-closing purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and similar conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  
For the purposes of this Section 4.2(d), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the applicable transaction, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to such transaction, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in such transaction by holders of Common Stock for each share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration received in such transaction is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, the Committee may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of a Stock Option or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Acquisition Event.  An Award that vests, is earned or is paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant’s consent; provided, that a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation’s post-Acquisition Event corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.  
5.1GENERAL ELIGIBILITY.  All Eligible Employees and Consultants and prospective employees of and Consultants to the Company and its Affiliates are eligible to be granted Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units under this Plan or other Awards under this Plan providing benefits similar to each of the foregoing and which are designed to meet the requirements of Foreign Jurisdictions.  Eligibility for the grant of an Award and actual participation in this Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  The vesting and exercise of Awards granted to a prospective employee or Consultant are conditioned upon such individual actually becoming an Eligible Employee or Consultant.
6.1STOCK OPTIONS.  Stock Options granted hereunder shall not be incentive stock options intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.
6.2GRANTS.  The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any Eligible Employee or Consultant one or more Stock Options.

(a)GRANT PRICE.  The grant price per share of Common Stock shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of grant.
(b)STOCK OPTION TERM.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee; provided, however, that no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than 10 years after the date such Stock Option is granted.
(c)EXERCISABILITY.  Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant.  If the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any Stock Option is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that such Stock Option is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitations on exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, waiver of the installment exercise provisions or acceleration of the time at which such Stock Option may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.  Stock Options may not be exercised during any period prohibited by the Company’s stock trading policies or applicable securities laws.
(d)METHOD OF EXERCISE.  Subject to whatever installment exercise, waiting period, and other provisions and limitations apply under Paragraph (c) above, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time and from time to time during the Stock Option term by giving notice of exercise to the Company, pursuant to such electronic or other procedures as may be specified by the Company or its Plan administrator from time to time, specifying the number of shares to be purchased.  Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price as follows: 
(ii)if the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange, or quoted on a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through a “cashless exercise” procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Stock Options and remit promptly to the Company an amount equal to the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes; or 
(iii)on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company or its Plan administrator from time to time (including, without limitation, the relinquishment of Stock Options or by payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock owned by the Participant by either actual delivery or attestation (and for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances) based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the exercise date as determined by the Company or its Plan administrator).  No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until payment therefor, as provided herein, has been made or provided for.  
(e)FORM, MODIFICATION, EXTENSION AND RENEWAL OF STOCK OPTIONS.  Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of this Plan, Stock Options shall be evidenced by such form of written or electronic Award Agreement or grant as is approved by the Committee from time to time, and the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Stock Options granted under this Plan (provided that the rights of a Participant are not reduced without his or her consent).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not reduce the grant price of a Stock Option and shall not exchange a Stock Option for a new Award with a lower (or no grant price) without approval of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Delaware.
(g)AUTOMATIC EXERCISE.  The Plan administrator may provide in a Stock Option Agreement or otherwise that any Stock Option outstanding on the last 
business day of the term of such Stock Option (""Automatic Exercise Date"") that has a ""Specified Minimum Value"" shall be automatically and without further action by the Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's personal representative or estate), be exercised on the Automatic Exercise Date.  Payment of the grant price of such Stock Option may be made pursuant to such procedures as may be approved by the Plan administrator from time to time and the Company shall deduct or withhold an amount sufficient to satisfy all taxes associated with such exercise in accordance with Section 12.4.   For purposes of this Section 6.3(g), the term ""Specified Minimum Value"" means that the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock exceeds the grant price of a share subject to an expiring Stock Option by at least $0.50 cents per share or such other amount as the Plan administrator shall determine from time to time.  The Plan administrator may elect to discontinue the automatic exercise of Stock Options pursuant to this Section 6.3(g) at any time upon notice to a Participant.  The automatic exercise of a Stock Option pursuant to this Section 6.3(g) shall apply only to a Stock Option award that has been timely accepted by a Participant under procedures specified by the Plan administrator from time to time.
7.1AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  Awards of Restricted Stock Units may be issued to Eligible Employees or Consultants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under this Plan.  The Committee shall determine the Eligible Employees or Consultants to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock Units will be made, the number of units to be awarded, the time or times within which such Awards may be subject to forfeiture, the vesting schedule and rights to acceleration thereof, and all other terms and conditions of the Awards.  An Award Agreement may condition the grant or vesting of Restricted Stock Units upon the attainment of Performance Goals or such other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.
8.1PERFORMANCE GOALS, FORMULAE OR STANDARDS.  The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Awards under the Plan upon the attainment of specified performance goals (“Performance Goals”) or such other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.  Such Performance Goals may incorporate provisions for disregarding (or adjusting for) changes in accounting methods, corporate transactions (including, 
9.1NON-TRANSFERABILITY.  Except as otherwise provided herein, no Stock Option, Restricted Stock Unit or other Award shall be Transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the Participant’s lifetime, only by the Participant.  No Award shall, except as otherwise specifically provided by law or herein, be Transferable in any manner, and any attempt to Transfer any such Award shall be void, and no such Award shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person who shall be entitled to such Award, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such person.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Committee may determine at the time of grant or thereafter that a Stock Option that is otherwise not Transferable pursuant to this Section 9.1 is Transferable to, and exercisable by, a Family Member in whole or in part and in such circumstances, and under such conditions, as specified by the Committee.  A Stock Option that is Transferred to a Family Member pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) may not be subsequently Transferred during the employee’s lifetime other than to the employee or another Family Member, and (ii) remains subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award Agreement.
(i)TERMINATION BY REASON OF DEATH OR DISABILITY.  If a Participant’s Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of death or Disability, all Stock Options held by such Participant shall become fully exercisable on the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy and may be exercised by the Participant (or, in the case of death, by the legal representative of the Participant’s estate) at any time within a period of one year from the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated terms of such Stock Options.
unvested Stock Options held by such Participant shall continue to vest and all exercisable Stock Options may be exercised by the Participant, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated terms of such Stock Options.

(iv)TERMINATION FOR CAUSE OR FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DEATH, DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for Cause, all Stock Options held by such Participant shall thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability, Retirement, or other than an involuntary Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy without Cause, including, without limitation, a voluntary Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, all Stock Options held by such Participant may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Options.
10.1TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board or the Committee may at any time, and from time to time, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of this Plan (including any amendment deemed necessary to ensure that the Company may comply with any regulatory requirement referred to in Article XII), or suspend or terminate it entirely, retroactively or otherwise; provided, however, that, unless otherwise required by law or specifically provided herein, the rights of a Participant with respect to Awards granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination may not be impaired without the consent of such Participant and, provided further, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Delaware, to the extent required by the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3, no amendment may be made which would (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under this Plan; (ii) increase the maximum individual Participant limitations for a fiscal year under Section 4.1(b); (iii) change the classification of employees or Consultants eligible to receive Awards under this Plan; (iv) decrease the minimum option price of any Stock Option; (v) extend the maximum option period under Section 6.3; or (vi) materially alter the Performance Criteria for Awards as set forth in Exhibit A.
10.2The Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Article IV above or as otherwise specifically provided herein, no such amendment or other action by the Committee shall impair the rights of any Participant without the Participant’s consent.
12.3NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT/CONSULTANCY.  Neither this Plan nor the grant of any Award hereunder shall give any Participant or other employee or Consultant any right with respect to continuance of employment or Consultancy by the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall they be a limitation in any way on the right of the Company or any Affiliate by which an employee is employed or a Consultant is retained to terminate his or her employment or Consultancy at any time.
(a)Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, as long as the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange or system sponsored by a national securities association, the issue of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be conditioned upon such shares being listed on such exchange or system.  The Company shall have no obligation to issue such shares unless and until such shares are so listed, and the right to exercise any Stock Option with respect to such shares shall be suspended until such listing has been effected.

12.11DEATH/DISABILITY.  The Committee may in its discretion require the transferee of a Participant to supply it with written notice of the Participant’s death or Disability and to supply it with a copy of the will (in the case of the Participant’s death) or such other evidence as the Committee deems necessary to establish the validity of the Transfer of an Award.  The Committee may also require the agreement of the transferee to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Plan.

Report of the Compensation Committee
2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and the other Named Executive Officers, and administering Vishay's incentive compensation and equity-based plans.
 of which 75% vests only upon the achievement of three-year performance metrics and the balance of which vests on January 1 of the third year following the grant date
Some of the compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table, including certain equity-based compensation, deferred cash compensation, retirement benefits, and phantom stock units, has not yet been realized by the executives, and in the case of equity-compensation measured on the grant date, might never be fully realized.
Accordingly, we grant stock awards with multi-year vesting periods and our performance-based RSUs vest based on three-year performance results to encourage our officers to focus on long-term performance. An annual vote would allow our executive compensation programs to be evaluated regularly and in relation to our long-term performance.
Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors; and

An annual grant of RSUs on the first stock trading day of the year, determined as a total incentive value of $165,000 divided by the closing stock price of the last trading day of the previous fiscal year, vesting in 3 years or ratably upon earlier cessation of service.
Amounts represent the fair value of the RSUs granted, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 in the year of grant and the assumptions set forth in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K filed on February 15, 2019.

Compensation Committee - The functions of the Compensation Committee include evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer; establishing and approving all compensation for our Executive Officers; making recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation of non-management directors; making recommendations to the Board with respect to, and administering, our incentive compensation plans and equity based compensation plans; and performing other related functions specified in the Committee's charter.  The Compensation Committee is authorized, within the limits of the 2007 Stock Incentive Program of Vishay (the ""2007 Program""), to determine the individuals who are to receive grants, including stock, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (""RSUs""), and the vesting requirements with respect to those grants, and to administer and interpret the plan.  The current chairman of the Committee is Mr.
The chairman of the Compensation Committee presides at the executive sessions of the Board's independent directors.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee considers risk issues when establishing and administering our compensation programs for executive officers and other key personnel.
The Board and its Committees exercise their risk oversight function by carefully evaluating the reports they receive from management and by making inquiries of management with respect to areas of particular interest to the Board.
A stockholder wishing to recommend to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee a candidate for election as director must submit the recommendation in writing, addressed to the Committee, care of our Corporate Secretary, at Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, PA 19355.  Submissions must be made by mail, courier, or personal delivery.  E-mailed submissions will not be considered.  Submissions recommending candidates for election at an annual meeting of stockholders must generally be received no later than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the prior annual meeting of stockholders.  In the event that the date of an annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days following the first anniversary date of the annual meeting of stockholders for the prior year, the submission must be made a reasonable time in advance of the mailing of our proxy statement for the current year.   Each nominating recommendation must be accompanied by the information called for by our ""Procedures for Securityholders' Submission of Nominating Recommendations,"" which is posted on our website.  This includes specified information concerning the stockholder or group of stockholders making the recommendation and the proposed nominee, any relationships between the recommending stockholder or stockholders and the proposed nominee and the qualifications of the proposed nominee to serve as director.  The recommendation must also be accompanied by the consent of the proposed nominee to serve if nominated and elected and the agreement of the nominee to be contacted by the Committee, if the Committee decides in its discretion to do so.
The following table shows the number of shares of Vishay common stock and Class B common stock beneficially owned by (a) each director and director nominee, (b) each ""Executive Officer"" identified under ""Executive Compensation,"" (c) the directors, director nominees, and executive officers of Vishay as a group, and (d) any person owning more than 5% of Vishay common stock or the Class B common stock.  Unless otherwise noted, the information is stated as of March 18, 2019, and the beneficial owners exercise sole voting or dispositive power over their shares.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee was at any time during 2018 an officer or employee of Vishay or any of the Company's subsidiaries nor was any such person a former officer of Vishay or any of the Company's subsidiaries.  In addition, no Compensation Committee member is an executive officer of another entity at which one of the Company's executive officers serves on the board of directors.
Officers serve, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, until the meeting of the Board of Directors next following each annual meeting of stockholders, subject to their rights under any contracts of employment described under ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis.""
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes and approves all compensation for all Executive Officers and administers Vishay's incentive and equity-based compensation plan.
SEC disclosure rules require tabular presentation regarding the compensation of the registrant's principal executive officer (""PEO""), principal financial officer (""PFO""), and the registrant's three mostly highly compensated executive officers other than the PEO and PFO.  Because the Compensation Committee determines compensation for all Executive Officers, this Compensation Discussion and Analysis discusses compensation of all eight of our Executive Officers.  The required ""Compensation Tables"" beginning on page 45 include only the five executives required to be disclosed in this manner by SEC rules.
The Compensation Committee and Vishay's management believe that compensation should help to recruit, retain, and motivate key employees who can function effectively both in periods of recession and economic expansion.  Ordinarily an executive officer's total compensation should consist of a combination of cash payments and equity awards, to achieve the right balance between short- and long-term performance.  Equity-based compensation should serve to align the interests of management with those of stockholders.  Severance protection and retirement benefits should provide executives with an appropriate level of job security, commensurate with their contributions to the Company and their tenure.
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Dr.
The Company's compensation philosophy is intended to integrate with its philosophy of evaluating operating performance.  The Company utilizes several measures and metrics to evaluate its performance, as further described in ""Performance Measures and Metrics"" below, and in turn, the Compensation Committee utilizes similar measures in evaluating executive officer compensation.
The Compensation Committee believes that the elements of compensation for the Company's senior executives reward intrinsically sound management decisions and do not encourage risk taking to enhance short-term profitability at the expense of the long-term health and viability of the enterprise.  While the design of our executive compensation program is primarily performance-based, we do not believe that it encourages excessive risk-taking. The Committee believes that the Company's senior executives have taken a prudent approach to corporate risk management. In addition, the Company has in place a risk management program designed to identify, evaluate and control risks.
The factors considered by the Compensation Committee in evaluating the risks arising from compensation arrangements, which have been incorporated into the terms and conditions of such compensation arrangements, include, in no particular weighting or order of prominence:
While annual cash bonuses focus on the achievement of short-term or annual goals and short-term goals may encourage risk-taking, annual cash bonuses for Executive Officers are capped in order to balance the risk; and
Paul, have this type of agreement.  The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation arrangement with Mr.
The Compensation Committee reviews the total compensation level of our Executive Officers each year, considering individual performance, prior years' compensation level, recent operating results, operating results of competitors, projections for the future, other components of the executive pay packages, perceived salary trends in executive base salary among the peer group of Vishay and input on executive performance from the Chief Executive Officer.
The determination is subjective and the Compensation Committee does not assign any quantitative weight to these factors. 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (""PwC"") to advise on compensation matters as the Committee considered 2017 compensation, upon the appointment of new Executive Officers.
The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant in 2018 as no significant changes to executive compensation took place and no new Executive Officers were appointed during the year.
The peer group of companies were recommended by PwC and accepted by the Compensation Committee, and included the following public companies:
After considering the salaries and compensation practices of executive officers of comparable public companies identified by PwC, the total compensation of the executive officers was based on a determination by the Compensation Committee that it was appropriate to establish a mix of cash and equity compensation that was reasonable when compared to, but not necessarily within, the market-competitive range of compensation offered to similarly situated executives of comparable public companies.
In addition to the information provided by PwC, the Compensation Committee considered the roles that each executive plays and is expected to play in Vishay's operations, development, and strategic planning.  Our succession plan provides for the transition of Mr. Zandman into the role of Chief Executive Officer upon the eventual retirement of Dr.
Vandoorn, Valletta, and Gebhardt.  This same metric, for a multi-year period, is also used in connection with performance-based RSUs granted for all Executive Officers.  Although the term ""free cash"" is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate ""free cash"" is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP as follows:
At the grant date, the Compensation Committee may provide for certain pre-defined adjustments to this metric.  For the performance-based RSU's granted in 2018, the free cash target measure was adjusted by adding the total cash paid pursuant to restructuring programs disclosed in the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Zandman, as mentioned above, reflect their positions and tenure as executive officers of the Company.  As such, these agreements include compensation components other than base salary, cash performance-based incentive compensation, and equity-based compensation, which are not available to our other Executive Officers.  These other components include deferred compensation, certain additional severance benefits, annual grants of phantom stock units, and customary welfare and retirement benefits.
The minimum base salary levels for the Executive Officers are fixed in their respective employment agreements.  The Compensation Committee determined the minimum base salaries, based upon the executives' salary level, present responsibilities, expectations with respect to future responsibilities and a comparison to peer group executive salaries. The Compensation Committee selected the group of peer group companies on the advice of PwC.  Compensation practices in the peer group were only one of the factors considered by the Compensation Committee.  The base salaries of Dr.
Over many years, we have viewed adjusted net earnings as the primary indicator of the performance of our executive management team.  As more specifically addressed below, adjusted net earnings refers to net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to eliminate the after tax effects of items, positive or negative, that do not relate to our intrinsic operations.  These items include, among others, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, severance and restructuring costs, special tax items, and other items, such as unusual gains or losses that impact GAAP net earnings, not reflecting on-going operating activities.  The calculation of adjusted net earnings is set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K as well as under the heading ""Performance Measures and Metrics"" in this proxy statement.  We utilize this measure in part because it eliminates factors that mask the actual performance of on-going operations and because of its currency with other public companies in our industry.  Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that the incentive compensation of Dr.
Zandman, is a straight percentage of adjusted net earnings pursuant to the Cash Bonus Plan, and other elements of such bonuses are expressed as a percentage of base salary, measured against specific performance goals.  Performance goals for purposes of the annual bonus award are recommended by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Compensation Committee.
(1) Amount paid limited by the cap set by the Compensation Committee    
Zandman is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee following the end of the year, and each executive is assigned a performance score for several categories.  For a discussion of 2018 goals and achieved results for the other Executive Officers, see ""Evaluation of Achievements for Cash Performance-Based Incentive Compensation.""
The 2007 Program permits the grant of up to 6,500,000 shares of restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), stock options, and phantom stock units to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.
The Compensation Committee believes that the grant of equity awards is the primary tool for aligning interests of the executive officers with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders.  Accordingly, the Compensation Committee includes a long-term incentive (LTI) component in the form of equity-based compensation in each of the executives' employment agreements.
In establishing the amount of equity awards, the Compensation Committee utilized the market-competitive range of equity awards granted to similarly situated executive officers of the peer group companies.  The Compensation Committee concluded that a grant of equity awards within such market-competitive range was appropriate to reward and incentivize our executive officers.
The employment agreements of the Executive Officers provide for annual grants of equity based compensation in the form of RSUs.  Of the total RSUs granted, 25% are in the form of time-vested RSUs that carry only a service condition.
The PBRSUs will vest at the conclusion of the three–year performance periods if certain defined performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee (based on adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and/or free cash over a three year period) are realized.
50% of the PBRSUs will vest if 80% of the applicable objective is met, and the proportion of PBRSUs subject to such criterion will increase by 2.5% for each additional 1% of the applicable objective (between 80% and 100%).  For 2018, the grants were sized based upon a percentage of base salary, as of the date of grant, as follows:
The number of RSUs granted annually to each executive is determined by multiplying the executive's base salary for the applicable year by the respective percentage set forth above and dividing by the closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day preceding January 1 of the applicable year.  The time-vested RSUs carry only a service condition and vest on January 1 of the third year following the grant.  The PBRSUs include performance conditions agreed to with the Compensation Committee in its role as administrator of the 2007 Program (based on adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and/or free cash over a three year period).  Performance-based targets related to the PBRSUs are set at levels intended to be attainable without the need to take inappropriate risks.
The PBRSUs contain a three-year service period and are subject to the Compensation Committee certifying that all performance criteria have been satisfied.
In 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded the following RSUs (including PBRSUs) to certain executive officers:
For financial accounting purposes, the grant-date fair value is determined on the date that the Compensation Committee approves the number of RSUs to be granted under this provision.  Accordingly, the value of the grant on that date will be different than the LTI value described in the table above.
Beginning in January 2017, any RSUs granted to such executive officers that remain outstanding at the time of such executive officer's retirement after age 62 in accordance with the terms of his or her employment agreement with the Company shall, in the case of time-vested RSUs, become fully vested upon such retirement and, in the case of PBRSUs, vest if and to the extent the applicable performance criteria are met in accordance with current vesting schedules.
The PBRSU awards granted in 2014, 2015, and 2016 vested on January 1, 2017, January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019, respectively, as the performance obligations associated with those awards were met in full.
The PBRSU awards granted in 2017, 2018, and 2019 are expected to vest as the performance obligations associated with those awards are expected to be met, but remain subject to the Company's actual performance.
Zandman receive annual grants of 5,000 phantom stock units.  The grants are made under the 2007 Program.
Similar to the deferred cash compensation described below, the Compensation Committee considers the grant of phantom stock units in the nature of a retirement benefit and an inducement to loyalty to Vishay over time.
The number of units to be granted annually was determined at the inception of the 2004 agreements.  The cumulative increase in the number of phantom stock units held by the executives over time also is intended to strengthen the alignment of executive and stockholder interests in the long-term appreciation of Vishay's equity value.
The Compensation Committee also considers the award of extra-contractual equity-based compensation, when appropriate.  However, no such additional equity awards were granted to any Executive Officer in 2018.
Zandman each have a long-standing relationship with the Company, and we expect that each will continue to serve Vishay for so long as their services are desired and they can make effective management contributions.  The Compensation Committee therefore considers this deferred compensation in the nature of a retirement benefit and an anticipatory reward for loyalty to Vishay over time.  
The Compensation Committee believes that providing adequate postretirement benefits commensurate with position is essential to retaining qualified individuals for long-term employment.  Vishay maintains pension and retirement programs for, or makes certain government retirement programs available to, most of its employees around the world, including its Executive Officers.  The retirement benefits for Executive Officers pursuant to these programs are not materially preferential to those of other employees in those respective countries.
Zandman in 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to extend the severance benefits for these executives to also include any termination (other than for cause) after age 62.  This provision was added in light of the long-standing tenure of these executives and to ensure a smooth transition upon their retirement.
We provide executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that Vishay and the Compensation Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program.  These perquisites are not intended, however, to constitute a material portion of the executive's compensation package.  In general, the perquisites, while not integral to the performance of an executive's duties, must bear some relationship to the executive's employment and be of perceived benefit to Vishay.  The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Executive Officers.
The Compensation Committee believes that severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination of employment are part of a standard compensation package for senior executives.  The terms of these severance provisions are discussed in ""Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control.""

These benefits are required by Israeli law or employment practices generally, and were taken into account by the Compensation Committee in formulating the overall compensation package for our executive officers.
As part of its role, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the tax deductibility of executive compensation.  The exemptions for performance-based compensation had a significant influence on the historical design of our executive compensation programs.  Although, the Company will not receive the benefit of deductibility for new awards of performance-based compensation that are in excess of the $1 million deductibility cap, the Compensation Committee continues to view pay for performance as an important part of our executive compensation policy.
On August 21, 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Board reviewed and considered the Board's recommendation to the Company's stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation (""say on pay"") every three years (""say on frequency"").

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes and approves all compensation for all Executive Officers and administers Vishay's incentive and equity-based compensation plan.  Because the Compensation Committee determines compensation for all Executive Officers, the ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis"" section discusses compensation of all eight of our Executive Officers.  The compensation tables which follow include only the five executives required to be disclosed in this manner by SEC rules (""Named Executive Officers"").
Paul is representative of a special transaction bonus granted upon the successful completion of the MOSFETs Enhanced Competitiveness Program.
Column (e) represents the grant-date fair value of RSUs and PBRSUs granted in the respective years determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 in the year of grant and the assumptions set forth in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K filed on February 15, 2019.  The grant-date fair value is recognized for accounting purposes over the period the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the respective awards.  At the grant date, the Company expected all performance-based vesting criteria to be achieved.  Accordingly, Column (e) includes the grant-date fair value for the PBRSUs.   The common stock underlying the RSU and PBRSU awards is not received until the awards are vested (in some cases, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions) and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.
Column (e) also includes the grant-date fair value of 5,000 phantom stock units awarded annually to certain Named Executive Officers pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements.  The common stock underlying these awards is not received until termination of employment, and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.
Zandman and Vandoorn was limited by the caps set by the Compensation Committee and included in their respective employment agreements.
All other compensation includes amounts deposited on behalf of each Named Executive Officer into Vishay's non-qualified deferred compensation plan pursuant to the employment agreements with each Executive Officer, Jubilee service awards, personal use of company car, Company contributions to defined contribution plans outside of the United States, benefits generally available to employees in Israel, medical benefits in excess of normal group or government health insurance in country of residence, additional units of phantom stock granted as a result of dividends declared by the Company, and other perquisites, as described below (asterisk denotes amounts paid in foreign currency and translated at average exchange rates for the year):

the grant-date fair value of the RSUs.  The amount is calculated using the closing price of Vishay stock on the date of grant of $19.10 adjusted for the present value of expected dividends.  The common stock underlying these awards is not received until the awards are vested (in some cases, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions) and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.
the grant-date fair value of 5,000 phantom stock units awarded annually to certain executive officers pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements.  The amount is calculated using the closing price of Vishay stock on the grant date of $21.35.  The common stock underlying these awards is not received until termination of employment, and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.

Paul provide for Vishay to reimburse such Executive Officers for any excise tax.  The Compensation Committee believed in 2004, when such employment agreements were entered, that it would be unfair for the executive to be taxed in such a case because the payments are not intended to be made exclusively with respect to a change in control.  Current practice among our peer group companies is to not provide such benefits.  Accordingly, the employment agreements for Ms.
The table above excludes the 2019 annual grant for the current Executive Officers and includes the RSUs that vested January 1, 2019.
Certain executive officers receive an annual grant of 5,000 phantom stock units pursuant to their respective employment agreements.  Additionally, those executives receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional phantom stock units each time the Company pays a dividend on its common stock.  Upon termination of employment, each executive will receive one share of Vishay common stock for each phantom stock unit held.
The table above excludes the 2019 annual grant to certain executive officers of 5,000 phantom stock units and dividend equivalents received in 2019.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the 2019 base salaries for our Executive Officers, as follows:
The employment agreements of the executive officers provide for annual grants of equity-based compensation in the form of RSUs.
The parameters utilized to determine the number of units granted were the same as utilized in 2018, as described on page 33.
The grants for 2019 under these equity compensation arrangements are as follows:
Vest at the conclusion of the three-year period if certain defined performance criteria are realized, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO BE ISSUED UPON EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND RIGHTS
The 2007 Program provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, RSUs (including PBRSUs), and phantom stock units.  Therefore the shares available for future issuance are presented only in total for the program.
Nonetheless, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions of the stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions.
The Compensation Committee continually reviews the compensation program for our Named Executive Officers to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with the interests of our stockholders and current market practices.

In addition to annual bonuses related to performance, management may also recommend that the Compensation Committee grant bonuses to new executive officers upon hire or existing executive officers upon promotion.

We are not aware of any interlocking relationships between any member of our Board or the Human Resources Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company during 2018 that would require disclosure under the applicable securities rules or regulations.
Annual Restricted Stock Grant
**The annual restricted stock grant occurs each February and, beginning with the February 2018 award, vests 100% one year from the date of grant.
For restricted stock grants made prior to February 2018, vesting is three years from the date of grant.
Coll, who joined our board in August 2018, received 2,205 shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of $114,991, effective as of the grant date of February 27, 2018.
If a non-employee director takes office after the February restricted stock grant, as was the case with Ms.
Coll in 2018, the new director’s restricted stock grant is pro-rated based on the date of election.
Coll received 927 shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of $57,520, effective as of the August 21, 2018 grant date.
The ultimate value of NEO long-term incentive awards depends upon the value of Viad common stock at the time of vesting (or exercise, in the case of stock options), which encourages NEOs to consider the inherent risk of short-term decisions that may affect our future performance.
Includes 77,773 shares of restricted stock, which will vest three years from the date of grant and 46,789 shares of common stock subject to stock options, which were exercisable as of March 1, 2019, or within 60 days thereafter, by the non-employee directors and executive officers.
All equity awards granted to our CEO were performance units.
The Human Resources Committee has the discretion to change the comparator group from time to time to help ensure that it provides a reasonable point of comparison for our executive officer compensation program.
Except for the CEO, whose long-term incentive award consisted entirely of performance units in 2018, we granted restricted stock awards to the NEOs and other executives who had a significant impact on our operational and financial goals.
Restricted stock awards vest three years after the date of grant and the holding period will continue unless and until the NEOs and other executives meet our stock ownership guidelines.

outstanding vested, but not exercised, stock options; and
any gain (without regard to tax effects) realized from the exercise of an option subject to the clawback provisions.
Under the clawback provisions, a Participant must forfeit any long-term incentive awards covered by those agreements if employment is terminated due to retirement, death, disability, or termination without cause within 12 months after the grant date.
Certain of our PUP awards granted prior to November 2, 2017 may be eligible to qualify under the performance-based exception.
The amounts presented below in column (e), “Stock Awards” do not reflect actual pay, but rather represent the grant date fair value of awards granted to the NEOs and may not reflect the actual value to be realized by each NEO.
For tax purposes, the actual value realized by the NEOs will not be determined until the time of vesting for restricted stock, vesting and settlement for performance units, or until option exercise, for option awards.
The amounts shown under column (e) reflect the grant date fair value of long-term incentives awarded (other than stock options) to the NEOs, comprising restricted stock and performance units granted in the years 2016 through 2018.
The grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted in 2016, 2017, and 2018 were computed by multiplying (i) the number of shares or units awarded to each NEO, assuming achievement at target level, by (ii) the closing price of the underlying shares on the grant date.
If achievement is at maximum level, the grant date fair values of the 2018 performance unit awards would be $4,600,047 for Mr.

OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018
Upon normal or early retirement, NEOs would receive ownership of the restricted stock (or units) and earned performance units awarded to them upon the lapse of the vesting period on a pro-rata basis (percentage of time from the grant date to the retirement date), provided that the NEO’s retirement occurs at least 12 months after the grant date of such awards and the executive executes a satisfactory agreement and release.

Upon a change in control, regardless of whether there is also a termination of employment, the NEOs would be entitled to receive a cash payment for performance units granted under the PUP, calculated as if each of the pre-defined targets were met at 100%, and prorated from the start date of the performance period to the date of the change in control.
If we terminate Ms. Ingersoll without cause (as that term is defined in the Defined Contribution Plan) within three years after a change in control, she will receive any company discretionary contribution that would have been credited to her company discretionary contribution account had she continued to be employed through the earlier of: (i) age 60; or (ii) the third anniversary of her termination date.
All restricted stock awards granted to the NEOs in 2016 and 2017 will vest on a pro-rata basis, and the executives will receive a pro-rata share of all earned performance units granted in 2016 and 2017 at the end of the three-year performance period.
