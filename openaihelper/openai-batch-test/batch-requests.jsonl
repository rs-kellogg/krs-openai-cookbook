earned.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, if we deliver TSR that simply matches that of the XSOX, MSU participants earn just 61.5% of their target number of MSUs.\u00a0\u00a0The Compensation Committee feels that this approach provides a stronger pay-for-performance alignment and appropriately distinguishes our program from the most common MSU design among our peers, which provides target payments for delivering TSR that simply matches that of the benchmark index or peer group (vs.\nrequiring 25 points of TSR outperformance).\u00a0\u00a0For more information on the design of our MSU program for awards granted in 2014, see \u201cLong-term Incentives \u2013 MSU Awards\u201d below.\nOver the past three fiscal years, ~48% of our CEO\u2019s target total direct compensation has been awarded in the form of MSUs.\u00a0\u00a0While we have delivered positive TSR during the relevant performance cycles, as of the end of FY14, given the performance requirements of our MSU awards, our CEO forfeited 100% of the MSUs he was granted in FY12.\u00a0\u00a0These MSUs represented ~72% of his target total direct compensation for FY12.\u00a0\u00a0As of the end of FY 2014, he was on track to earn between 0% and ~28% of the target number of his other outstanding MSUs awards for the relevant performance periods, using the closing price of our common stock on January 2, 2015 of $47.51.\nUpdate on MSU Grants awarded to CEO from FY12 to FY14\nGrant\nTarget Pay\u2014includes base salary, target cash bonus amount, other compensation paid and the \u201cfair value\u201d at grant of equity awards (i.e.,\u00a0the accounting value of RSUs and MSUs).\nRealizable pay calculations assume equity awards are 100% vested upon grant, even though all such awards actually vest over three years.\nFor more information on the various elements of compensation and the design of our MSU program for awards granted in 2014, see \u201cLong-term Incentives \u2013 MSU Awards\u201d below.\nRole of Compensation Committee.\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for administering our executive compensation program, as well as determining and approving the compensation for our Named Executive Officers.\nThe Compensation Committee regularly reports to our Board of Directors on its deliberations and actions.\nThe Compensation Committee uses a balanced approach to set the compensation of our executive officers, with each primary direct component of compensation (base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive compensation) designed to play a specific role in achieving this objective.\nThe Compensation Committee determines the compensation of each executive officer with respect to each compensation component based, in part, on its own analysis of competitive market data and the recommendations of our CEO, both as described below.\nThe Compensation Committee exercises its own judgment in making its compensation decisions and may accept or reject our CEO\u2019s recommendations.\nIn addition, the Compensation Committee receives input from its compensation consultant and meets in executive session (without our CEO present) prior to making its final determinations regarding compensation.\nDifferences in compensation among our executive officers are the result of the Compensation Committee\u2019s exercise of its judgment, following its review of our CEO\u2019s recommendations, its analysis of competitive market data and its consideration of overall Company performance, competitive pressures, business conditions, the value of current equity holdings and the potential financial impact of its compensation decisions.\nIn determining the compensation of our CEO, the Compensation Committee consults with the other independent members of our Board of Directors, assesses our CEO\u2019s individual performance, and considers competitive market data and the other factors described above.\nIn carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee works with members of our management, including our CEO.\nTypically, our management assists the Compensation Committee by providing information on Company performance and its perspective on compensation matters.\nOur CEO generally attends Compensation Committee meetings (except with respect to discussions involving his own compensation).\nTypically, our CEO formulates recommendations for the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of our executive officers (except with respect to his own compensation) based on a review of the competitive market data developed by the Compensation Consultant, his performance evaluation of each executive officer and other considerations, including competitive pressures, business conditions, the value of current equity holdings, each individual\u2019s tenure, compensation history, prior experience, distinctive value to the Company, variances in job responsibilities relative to similarly titled executives at other companies, the appropriate mix of compensation components, the Company\u2019s overall performance and the potential financial impact (including dilution and compensation cost) associated with their compensation.\nOur CEO conducts this assessment with the assistance of our Vice President of Human Resources.\u00a0\u00a0Our CEO then makes formal recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding adjustments to base salary, annual cash incentive award opportunities and equity awards for our executives (except with respect to his own compensation).\nWhile the Compensation Committee solicits and reviews our CEO\u2019s recommendations and proposals with respect to compensation-related matters, the Compensation Committee only uses these recommendations and proposals as one factor in making its own compensation decisions for our executive officers.\nThe Compensation Committee is authorized to retain the services of compensation consultants and other advisors from time to time, as it sees fit, in connection with the administration of our executive compensation programs.\nThe Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm providing executive compensation advisory services (\u201cCompensia\u201d), to provide competitive market data and analysis regarding material elements of compensation, including base salary, cash incentives and equity incentives.\nCompensia served at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.\nWith the approval of the Compensation Committee, Compensia also provides our CEO and our Vice President of Human Resources with market data regarding compensation for our executive officers so that our CEO\u2019s compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee are consistent with our compensation philosophy.\nThe Compensation Committee believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders to ensure that our executive compensation is competitive with that of other companies of similar size and complexity.\nAt the end of 2013, the Compensation Committee directed Compensia to use data gathered from the 2013 Radford Executive Compensation Survey and publicly-available information from the following companies to identify and analyze the competitive market for executive compensation:\nThe Compensation Committee does not use a prescribed formula for allocating compensation between annual and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of non-cash compensation.\nAnnual Cash Incentive Awards.\u00a0\u00a0Each year, the Compensation Committee adopts a bonus plan (the \u201cBonus Plan\u201d) to reward exceptional performance and align the financial incentives of our Named Executive Officers with our short-term operating plan and long-term strategic objectives and the interests of our stockholders.\nThe Compensation Committee approves the design, structure, and performance objectives, as well as each objective\u2019s relative weighting, under the Bonus Plan.\nThe Compensation Committee designs the Bonus Plan to pay each executive officer up to 150% of his target annual cash incentive award opportunity for outstanding performance.\nConsistent with our \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d philosophy, however, no payment is guaranteed if an executive officer fails to meet the minimum established performance objectives for his award opportunity under the Bonus Plan.\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, the Compensation Committee established a target annual cash incentive award opportunity under the Bonus Plan for each of our Named Executive Officers as a specified percentage of his or her base salary.\nTypically, the Compensation Committee establishes one or more corporate financial metrics tied to our annual operating plan as the principal measures for determining each executive officer\u2019s annual cash incentive award.\nFor 2014, consistent with our business strategy, the Compensation Committee established adjusted revenue and adjusted operating income as a percentage of adjusted revenue as the principal corporate financial metrics.\nFor purposes of cash incentive awards, the Compensation Committee reserves the authority to determine whether to exclude any item when making adjustments from the corresponding GAAP metric.\u00a0\u00a0To reflect their functional roles and responsibilities, the Compensation Committee established corporate financial metrics as set forth in the table below for the purpose of determining the annual cash incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers.\u00a0\u00a0With respect to each of these corporate financial metrics, the percentage payout was to be determined using a sliding scale based on actual performance, with no minimum payout and a maximum payout of 150% of the portion of the executive\u2019s target annual cash incentive award opportunity for above-target performance.\nTo ensure a direct correlation between our short-term performance and our actual business results, the Compensation Committee makes quarterly payments to our Named Executive Officers under the Bonus Plan.\nOur Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion either to make payments absent attainment of the relevant performance metric target levels or to reduce or increase the size of any award payment.\nNeither the Board of Directors nor the Compensation Committee exercised such discretion in 2014.\nThe Compensation Committee uses long-term incentive compensation, typically in the form of equity awards, for our Named Executive Officers, to retain talent, to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and to provide incentives that we believe encourage behaviors that will maximize stockholder value.\nFor 2014, the Compensation Committee approved the use of a mix of MSUs and RSUs.\nMSU Awards.\u00a0\u00a0Since 2012 we have awarded MSUs that compare our TSR against the XSOX.\u00a0\u00a0For MSU awards granted after the beginning of our FY 13, a payment equal to the target number of units can only be earned if our TSR exceeds the TSR results of the Index by 25 points.\nIn 2014, we granted MSUs using the same performance scale as the awards granted in FY13 and shown above, but we also made the following changes to the program terms:\nAdded a cap on MSU payouts if TSR is negative.\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing best practices, our Compensation Committee introduced a cap on MSU payouts such that in the event our TSR is negative, the maximum payout under the MSUs would be 100% of the target award (regardless of the amount of TSR outperformance relative to the XSOX).\u00a0\u00a0This feature was added to reflect leading best practices in program design and to further strengthen the program from a pay-for-performance and shareholder alignment perspective.\nRSU Awards.\u00a0The RSUs awarded in 2014 provide a retention incentive and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.\u00a0\u00a0These RSUs generally vest as to the underlying shares of common stock in three annual installments on each anniversary of the date of grant.\nGrant Date \nGrant \nGenerally, the equity awards granted under the Company\u2019s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on April 15, 2014, provide for accelerated vesting of any unvested shares in the event that such equity awards are not assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity in connection with a change in control of the Company or the executive officer is demoted, relocated, or terminated other than for misconduct within 18 months following the change in control transaction.\nThe terms and conditions of these acceleration provisions are provided at a level that the Compensation Committee believes to be comparable to those of companies of similar size in our industry sector.\nPerquisites and Other Personal Benefits.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the general welfare benefits described above, the Compensation Committee has determined that we provide our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, with an annual physical examination beyond the benefit provided under our standard health care plans.\nThe Compensation Committee does not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program and, except as described in the preceding paragraph, did not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers during 2014.\nDeductibility of Executive Compensation.\u00a0\u00a0In determining which elements of compensation are to be paid, and how they are weighted, the Compensation Committee takes into account the implications of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 162(m)\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0Generally, Section 162(m) prohibits us from taking a federal income tax deduction for remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to our CEO and each of the other three most highly-compensated executive officers (not including the CFO) of the Company in a taxable year.\u00a0\u00a0Remuneration in excess of $1 million may be deducted if, among other things, it qualifies as \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.\u00a0\u00a0In this regard, the compensation income realized upon the exercise of stock options granted under a stockholder-approved stock option plan generally will be deductible so long as the options are granted by a committee whose members are non-employee directors and certain other conditions are satisfied.\nThe Compensation Committee\u2019s policy is to qualify, to the extent practicable, the compensation of our executive officers for deductibility under applicable tax laws.\u00a0\u00a0The Compensation Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program to meet our stated business objectives, however, and, thus, reserves the right to pay compensation that is not tax-deductible if it determines that such a payment is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.\nAccounting Treatment of Executive Compensation.\u00a0\u00a0The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (\u201cASC Topic 718\u201d), formerly known as SFAS 123(R), for our stock-based awards.\u00a0\u00a0ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation cost for all stock-based awards made to employees (including our executive officers) and directors, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the grant date \u201cfair value\u201d of these awards.\u00a0\u00a0This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards.\u00a0\u00a0ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for his or her award.\nCompensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation\nWe, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis within the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement with the management of the Company.\u00a0\u00a0Based on such review and discussion, we are of the opinion that the executive compensation policies and plans provide appropriate compensation to properly align Silicon Laboratories\u2019 performance and the interests of its stockholders through the use of competitive and equitable executive compensation in a balanced and reasonable manner, for both the short- and long-term.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included as part of this Proxy filing.\nSubmitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors:\nAmounts shown do not reflect compensation actually received by the Named Executive Officer, but represent the grant date fair value as determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718 (disregarding any estimate of forfeitures).\u00a0\u00a0The assumptions underlying the calculation under ASC Topic 718 are discussed under Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2015.\nIncludes the grant date fair value of RSUs, $720,009, that were awarded to Mr.\nIncludes grant date fair

Named Executive Officers.\u00a0\u00a0All equity plan-based awards were granted under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on April 15, 2014, and all non-equity plan-based awards were granted under our 2014 Bonus Plan.\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE FOR FISCAL 2014\nGrant Date Fair \nGrant Date\nIncludes grant date fair value of both the MSUs and RSUs.\u00a0\u00a0A discussion

exercise of stock options and shares acquired upon the vesting of RSUs with respect to our Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2014.\nOPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED TABLE DURING FISCAL 2014\nExercise\nValue Realized on Exercise\nAt our 2009 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, our stockholders approved the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2009 Plan\u201d) and the 2009 Plan became effective immediately.\u00a0\u00a0On April 15, 2014, our stockholders approved amendments of the 2009 Plan.\u00a0\u00a0The amendments updated the 2009 Plan to comply with changes in local laws, authorized additional shares of common stock for future issuance, improved the Company\u2019s corporate governance, and implement other best practices.\u00a0\u00a0Under our prior 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2000 Plan\u201d), no shares remain issuable except for those that were subject to outstanding awards as of the date of approval of the 2009 Plan.\u00a0 The 2009 Plan and the 2000 Plan (together, the \u201cPlans\u201d) govern the equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers and other participants.\u00a0\nDiscretionary Acceleration of Awards:\u00a0\u00a0Our Compensation Committee, as plan administrator of the Plans has the authority to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding equity awards at any time, including in the event of a change in control of the Company, by means of a \u201chostile take-over\u201d or otherwise, whether or not those awards are assumed or replaced or otherwise continued in effect.\u00a0 Under the 2000 Plan, any options so accelerated shall remain exercisable until the expiration or sooner termination of the option term in the case of a hostile take-over.\nAcceleration Upon Termination After a Change in Control:\u00a0\u00a0During a change in control, our Compensation Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting if a participant (including a Named Executive Officers) is Involuntarily Terminated within a period of 18 months following a change in control.\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to this authority, the terms of the stock options and stock awards granted to the Named Executive Officers and other participants under the Plans provide for such acceleration in vesting in the event of Involuntary Termination within 18 months following a change in control.\u00a0\u00a0Under the 2000 Plan, any options so accelerated shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) one year from the date of the participant\u2019s termination and (ii) the expiration of the option term in the case of a change of control, and until the expiration or sooner termination of the option term in the case of a hostile take-over.\u00a0\u00a0Involuntary Termination includes termination by the successor company for reasons other than misconduct or resignation by the individual following a material reduction in duties, a greater than 15% reduction in compensation, or involuntary relocation by more than 50 miles.\nCompensation

Practices\n Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022\n Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2022\nA shareholder may revoke a proxy, whether submitted via telephone, the Internet or mailed, at any time prior to its exercise by filing with Pediatrix\u2019s Secretary a duly executed revocation of proxy, by properly submitting, either by telephone, mail or Internet, a proxy to Pediatrix\u2019s Secretary bearing a later date or by appearing at the meeting and voting online.\nThe Board of Directors elected to exercise direct oversight over this area, rather than acting through one of the committees, given the increasing importance of such matters and the cross-functional impacts of technology on the Company\u2019s business.\nDIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  \u00a0 \u00a0 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  In 2022, none of our executive officers or Directors was a member of the Board of Directors of any other company where the relationship would be considered a compensation committee interlock under the SEC rules.\n \u2022\u2003In 2021, shareholders overwhelmingly expressed their support for the changes to our executive compensation program, including the target compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, the use of non-financial metrics in the annual bonus program and the elimination of off-cycle equity grants and bonuses.\nFor equity-based awards, we believe that our share price should ultimately reflect whether we have executed this strategy successfully and the three-year back end weighted vesting schedule (with half of the award vesting in year three) for equity grants ensures that our officers maintain a long-term perspective.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION: COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (\u201cCD&amp;A\u201d)  \u00a0 \u00a0 CEO Pay At-A-Glance  Over half of the target direct compensation (sum of base salary, target bonus and grant value of stock awards, including performance shares at target) of Dr.\u00a0James\u00a0D.\nWhen determining salaries, target bonus opportunities and annual equity grants for NEOs, the Compensation and Talent Committee also considers the performance of the Company and the individual, the nature of an individual\u2019s role within the Company, internal comparisons to the compensation of other Company officers, tenure with the Company and experience in the officer\u2019s current role.\nThe Compensation and Talent Committee uses guidelines and may apply either positive or negative discretion to adjust the bonuses based on the actual level of income from operations achieved, as well as other performance goals established for individual NEOs.\nEquity-Based Awards  2022 Equity-Based Awards  The Compensation and Talent Committee approved the annual equity-based awards outlined below in February 2022 with a March\u00a01, 2022 grant date for the then-current NEOs, Messrs.\n50% of the equity-based awards for 2022 were granted in performance shares that:  \u00a0\nThe Compensation and Talent Committee, working with its independent compensation consultant and Company management, evaluated the impact of various drivers on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in determining the 2022 grants.\nWhile this discussion of 2022 equity awards relates to performance targets for the 2022 performance period, we believe our approach to granting performance shares also creates long-term alignment, given that the value of the award realized by the NEOs will depend on the value of our stock when the shares vest over a multi-year period, with half of the performance shares vesting in the third year, as opposed to prior year grants where one-third of the performance shares vest in the third year.\n\u00a0 \u2022\u2003If shares are earned during this initial measurement period, they will vest at the rate of one-quarter per year over the first two anniversaries of the grant date (March 1, 2023 and March\u00a01, 2024) and one-half on the third anniversary of the grant date (March\u00a01, 2025), subject to continued employment.\n \u2022\u2003Shares will vest at the rate of one-quarter per year over the first two anniversaries of the grant date (March 1, 2023 and March\u00a01, 2024) and one-half on the third anniversary of the grant date (March\u00a01, 2025) subject to continued employment.\nOther Practices, Policies &amp; Guidelines  Equity Grant Practices  The Compensation and Talent Committee determines the effective date of annual equity-based awards without regard to current or anticipated stock price levels.\nThe Compensation and Talent Committee made the 2022 annual equity grant to named executive officers in March 2022 and may also make, and in the past has made, grants during the course of the year, primarily for new hires, promotions, to retain valued employees or to reward exceptional performance.\nThese grants may be subject to performance conditions and/or time-based vesting and are issued on the date of grant approval or upon a date certain following the grant approval date.\nThe Compensation and Talent Committee does not plan to grant off-cycle awards to any executive officers of the Company unless it is part of their initial hiring process.\nWe follow equity grant procedures designed to promote the proper authorization, documentation and accounting for all equity grants.\nPursuant to these procedures the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors must formally approve all equity awards during an in person or telephonic meeting or by the unanimous written consent executed by all members of the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors, as the case may be, it being understood that no equity award granted pursuant to any such written consent may have an effective date earlier than the date that all executed counterparts of such unanimous written consent are delivered to the General Counsel of the Company.\nThe grant-date fair value of our equity-based awards will be the closing sales price for a share of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the effective date of the grant as approved by the Compensation and Talent Committee or the Board of Directors, which date may not be prior to either the date such grant was approved or the commencement date of employment of the employee to whom the equity award is being made.\nThe policy also requires NEOs to retain 50% of net after-tax shares acquired during the year upon vesting (or exercise of stock options) unless his or her ownership level was satisfied as of the beginning of the year.\nRetirement and Deferred Compensation Plans  We maintain a Thrift and Profit Sharing Plan (the \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d), which is a 401(k) plan, to enable eligible employees to save for retirement through a tax-advantaged combination of elective employee contributions and our discretionary matching contributions and provide employees the \nMatching contributions under the 401(k) Plan are discretionary.\nThe amounts in this column reflect the grant-date fair value of the awards, calculated in accordance with the accounting guidance for equity-based compensation, but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures.\nThe amounts included for any performance-based restricted stock awards are calculated based on the most probable outcome of the performance conditions for such awards on the grant date.\nSee the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022 table for information on restricted stock awards granted in 2022.\nThe amounts in this column reflect the grant-date fair value of the awards, calculated in accordance with the accounting guidance for equity-based compensation, but excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures.\nFor 2020, additional compensation also includes $250,000 for a discretionary bonus and $16,009 for Mr.\u00a0Andreano\u2019s share of personal travel on an aircraft which Pediatrix previously leased.\nEXECUTIVE

description of our restricted stock and equity-based award granting policies, see the section entitled \u201c2022 Equity-Based Awards\u201d in CD&amp;A.\n The grant-date fair value of the performance share awards (based on the probable outcome of such conditions) and restricted stock awards is determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for equity-based compensation and represents the total amount that is expected to be expensed in our financial statements over the relevant vesting periods.\nOptionExercisePrice\n The vesting of the performance nonqualified stock option awards is contingent upon the satisfaction of one year of continuous service and the achievement of various stock price hurdles before the third anniversary of the grant date, which were achieved in 2021.\nOrdan and Andreano and the severance and other termination benefits paid to each of them was in accordance with their respective Employment Agreements and no discretionary severance amounts were paid.\nThe Employment Agreement for Mr.\u00a0Ordan provided that, in the event Mr.\u00a0Ordan\u2019s employment was terminated due to Disability or death, by the Company without Cause (which occurred effective December\u00a031, 2022), or by Mr.\u00a0Ordan for Good Reason, the time-based portion of the equity awards granted to Mr.\u00a0Ordan would immediately become fully vested,\u00a0non-forfeitable\u00a0and, if applicable, exercisable, and all performance based share awards would remain outstanding and vest based upon actual performance determined at the end of the applicable performance period.\nFurther, in the event Mr.\u00a0Richards, Ms.\u00a0Moore or Dr.\u00a0Swift\u2019s employment is terminated due to Disability or death, any time-based equity awards granted to the executive prior to termination of his or her employment will immediately become fully vested,\u00a0non-forfeitable\u00a0and, if applicable, exercisable, and all performance-based shares awards will remain outstanding and vest based upon actual performance determined at the end of the applicable performance period.\nIn addition, in the event of a Change of Control, (i)\u00a0all time-based equity awards granted to Mr.\u00a0Richards, Ms.\u00a0Moore or Dr.\u00a0Swift will immediately become fully vested,\u00a0non-forfeitable\u00a0and, if applicable, exercisable and (ii)\u00a0all performance-based equity awards granted to such executives for which the applicable performance condition has been met at the time of such Change in Control will immediately become fully vested,\u00a0non-forfeitable\u00a0and, if applicable, exercisable.\nMinus: Grant Date Fair Value of Awards Granted During the Current Year(8)\nMinus: Grant Date Fair Value of Awards Granted During the

applicable year, but adjusted as required by SEC rules to include the fair value of current and prior year equity awards that are outstanding, vested or forfeited during the applicable year, instead of the grant date value of awards granted during the applicable year.\nUnlike the SCT, which reflects the grant date fair value of equity awards granted during the applicable year, the CAP table

in street name by a brokerage firm, bank or trust.\u00a0 If you are a registered Shareholder holding your shares directly in your own name, your shares will NOT be voted unless you provide a Proxy or vote in person at the Annual Meeting.\u00a0 In the case of shares held in street name, brokerage firms generally have the authority to vote their clients' unvoted shares in their discretion on certain routine matters.\u00a0 For example, if your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm and you do not provide voting instructions, that firm can vote your shares with respect to the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors (Proposal 2), as this matter is considered routine under the applicable New York Stock Exchange (&quot;NYSE&quot;) rules.\u00a0 All other matters to be voted on at this year's Annual Meeting are not considered routine, and your broker voting on a routine matter cannot vote your shares on those non-routine matters without your instruction (&quot;broker

results.\nDirectors who are also employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for service as Directors.\u00a0 In 2017, Directors who are not employees of the Company will receive annual

Messrs.\nL\u00f6liger serves as Chairperson of the Compensation Committee.\u00a0 For further discussion regarding the Compensation Committee's processes and procedures for the consideration of executive compensation, see &quot;Compensation Discussion and Analysis.&quot;\n2016 Say-on-Pay Vote Results.\u00a0 At our Annual Meeting of Shareholders held in April 2016, we held a non-binding Shareholder Say-on-Pay vote on the 2015 compensation of our NEOs.\u00a0 Over 90% of the shares voted at last year's Annual Meeting voted FOR our Say-on-Pay resolution, approving the compensation of our NEOs.\u00a0 The Board's Compensation Committee (the &quot;Committee&quot;) believes the results of the Say-on-Pay vote show strong support for the performance-based and ownership-oriented compensation philosophy that the Committee has utilized.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Committee did not change its general approach to executive compensation in 2016, although the Committee has made changes to the short-term and long-term compensation programs, effective in 2017, as noted below.\u00a0 Although the advisory Shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Committee will continue to take the outcome of this annual vote into consideration when making compensation decisions for our NEOs.\n\uf0fc\u00a0Engage an independent compensation consultant for our Compensation Committee\n\uf0fb\u00a0Use individual qualitative factors in determining executives' annual cash bonuses\nIn 2015 our NEOs forfeited 28% of their 2012 performance-based equity grants.\nIn 2016 they forfeited 63% of their 2013 performance-based equity grants.\nIn 2017 they forfeited 34% of their 2014 performance-based equity grants.\nIn particular, the Company's CEO forfeited 42% of the aggregate grant-date fair value of performance shares granted him in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and this resulted in forfeiture of 19% of the CEO's aggregate total direct compensation for those three years.\nRole of the Compensation Committee.\u00a0 The Committee currently comprises four Non-Employee Directors, all of whom are independent under the NYSE listing standards.\u00a0 During 2016, the Committee members were Hans L\u00f6liger (Chairperson), Arnold Donald, William Little and Jim Turner.\u00a0 The Committee has responsibility for determining and implementing the Company's philosophy with respect to executive compensation.\u00a0 To implement this philosophy, the Committee oversees the establishment and administration of the Company's executive compensation program.\u00a0 The Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.\ngrowth and Shareholder value, and approximately two-thirds of the value of the restricted stock granted in 2016 under the Company's long-term incentive plan is tied to performance of the Company's total shareholder return versus that of a peer group.\u00a0 In addition, beginning in 2017, the Company's long-term incentive plan will also be tied to the Company's return on invested capital, as a second metric.\nUntil the ownership requirement is satisfied, an NEO is required to retain 50% of the after-tax value of any Common Stock received as the result of an option exercise or vesting of restricted shares.\u00a0 At year-end, all the NEOs either owned more than the minimum level of Common Stock or were otherwise in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.\nRetention of Compensation Consultants.\u00a0 The Committee's charter authorizes the Committee, in its sole discretion, to retain and terminate consultants to assist it in the evaluation of compensation for the NEOs.\u00a0 The Committee has sole authority to approve the fees and other retention terms of any such consultant.\nRole of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions.\u00a0 The Committee makes all decisions regarding the CEO's compensation.\u00a0 Decisions regarding the compensation of other NEOs are made by the Committee in consultation with, and upon the recommendation of, the CEO.\u00a0 In this regard, the CEO provides the Committee evaluations of business goals and objectives and executive performance and recommendations regarding salary levels, equity grants and other incentive awards.\nConsultant Independence.\u00a0 All services provided by Pay Governance to the Committee are conducted under the direction and authority of the Committee, and all work performed by Pay Governance must be pre-approved by the Committee.\u00a0 Pay Governance does not provide any other services to the Company, and neither Pay Governance nor the individuals who provide services to the Company owns any shares of the Company's stock.\u00a0 There are no personal or business relationships between the Pay Governance consultants and any executive of the Company.\u00a0 In addition, there are no personal relationships between the Pay Governance consultants and any member of the Committee.\u00a0 Pay Governance maintains a detailed conflict of interest policy in order to ensure that compensation committees receive conflict-free advice.\nAnnual Incentive Bonus.\u00a0 Annual cash bonuses are included as part of the executive compensation program because, consistent with our &quot;pay-for-performance&quot; philosophy, the Committee believes that a significant portion of each NEO's compensation should be contingent on success in achieving annual goals that drive the long-term operating performance of the Company.\nOur NEOs are eligible for annual cash bonuses under our shareholder-approved 2015 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan (the &quot;AIB Plan&quot;).\u00a0 For 2016, our NEOs were eligible to receive annual incentive bonuses under the AIB Plan upon the achievement of specified levels of economic profit and modified operating cash flow.\nWeighting of Performance Measures.\u00a0 At the beginning of 2016, the Committee determined target levels of performance for each performance measure.\u00a0 At year-end, the Committee assessed the actual results versus the original goals in determining awards.\u00a0 The Committee must approve all awards, and all awards are subject to review and downward discretionary adjustment by the Committee.\nLong-Term Equity Incentives.\u00a0 The Committee believes that equity-based incentives, delivered through annual grants of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock, are an important link between executive and Shareholder interests.\u00a0 Because the Committee believes that a significant portion of the benefits realized from long-term equity-based incentive grants should require continuous improvement in value created for the Shareholders, approximately two-thirds of the targeted value of stock awards to NEOs is performance-based.\u00a0 In 2016 and earlier periods, the Company used total shareholder return as the single performance metric for purposes of awarding performance-based shares.\u00a0 However, beginning in 2017, the Committee approved the use of return on invested capital as a second performance metric in awarding performance-based shares.\u00a0 The Committee believes that the use of this second metric will better align the Company's long-term incentive plan with its peers, with current market practice and with the expectations of\u00a0 Shareholders.\u00a0 Although the Committee may vary the size of annual grants based on the Company's and executive's performance, the total annual equity award granted to each NEO is generally determined based upon the difference between the total direct compensation target established by the Committee, using the competitive market benchmarking and internal factors described above, and the sum of the NEO's base salary and annual incentive bonus opportunity.\u00a0 See &quot;Compensation Strategy for CEO&quot; and &quot;Compensation Strategy for NEOs other than the CEO.&quot;\u00a0 In addition to the annual equity awards, the Committee may approve equity awards for newly hired executives or in recognition of an executive's promotion or expansion of responsibilities.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock.\u00a0 Approximately two-thirds of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive was delivered in performance-based restricted stock that may be earned based upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to a group of industry peers over a three-year performance period.\u00a0 A target number of shares was established for 2016 for each NEO, as set forth in the &quot;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&quot; table below.\u00a0 Actual vesting of performance-based share awards generally will not occur until the third anniversary of the grant date, if at all.\u00a0 The Committee believes that, in addition to linking a substantial portion of our NEOs' compensation to the long-term performance of the Company, the three-year vesting structure provides a strong retention element because an NEO terminating employment (other than for retirement with Committee approval, disability or death) will leave behind unvested awards.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock.\u00a0 Approximately one-third of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive was delivered in time-based restricted stock that vests in equal annual installments over three years from the date of the award in the amounts set forth on the &quot;Grants of Plan-Based Awards&quot; table below.\nIndustry Peer Group Composition.\u00a0 The Committee believes that for purposes of comparing shareholder returns it is appropriate to utilize a recognized publicly available index of container and packaging industry companies as the peer group.\u00a0 As a result, with respect to determining shareholder return for 2016 grants, the Committee will use the Dow Jones &quot;U.S.\nAs set forth above in &quot;Pay-for-Performance Alignment,&quot; NEOs forfeited performance-based shares granted in each of the last three years:\nTherefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2015 pursuant to the 2012 grant were vested at the 72% level, and 28% of the award was forfeited.\nTherefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2016 pursuant to the 2013 grant were vested at the 37% level, and 63% of the award was forfeited.\nThe number of performance-based shares from the 2013 grant in which each NEO vested in 2016 based on the Company's stock performance for the three-year calendar period ended December 31, 2015 are set forth below in the &quot;Option Exercises and Stock Vested&quot; table.\nThe Company's total shareholder return for the three-year calendar period ended December 31, 2016 was 18% based upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on that date (i.e., $52.57 per share) compared to the closing price on December 31, 2013 (i.e., $44.57 per share).\u00a0 When compared, however, to the total shareholder return of the other companies in the industry peer group at the time of the 2014 performance-based share award, the Company ranked at the 43rd percentile.\u00a0 Therefore, in accordance with the preceding schedule, the performance-based shares vesting in 2017 pursuant to the 2014 grant were vested at the 66% level, and 34% of the award was forfeited.\u00a0 Performance-based shares from the 2014 grant did not vest until January 2017 and, therefore, will be set forth in the &quot;Option Exercises and Stock Vested&quot; table in next year's Proxy Statement.\nNotwithstanding consistent positive shareholder return totaling 57% over the 2012 to 2016 time period that comprised the cumulative performance period for the 2012, 2013 and 2014 performance share grants, the Company's CEO at the time of the grants nevertheless forfeited 42% of the aggregate grant-date fair value of performance shares granted him in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\u00a0 This forfeiture, representing 19% of the CEO's aggregate total direct compensation for those three years, exemplifies the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.\n2016 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards.\u00a0 The following table sets forth the target number of time-based and performance-based restricted shares granted to the NEOs for 2016 as well as the minimum and maximum number of performance-based shares that may vest based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to the industry peer group over the applicable performance period.\u00a0 The table also sets forth the fair value of the shares on the date of grant based on a share price of $48.47 for time-based restricted stock and $51.05 for performance-based restricted stock (based on a Monte Carlo valuation model) for all NEOs with the exception of Robert Bourque.\u00a0 Mr.\nBourque was granted shares when he was promoted to President of the Asia Pacific Division in May 2016.\u00a0 The fair value on the date of grant was $53.87 per share for time-based restricted stock and $55.95 per share for performance-based restricted stock.\nPension Plan described above, the Company provides additional retirement benefits to the NEOs under the Senior Executive Retirement Plan (&quot;SERP&quot;).\u00a0 The annual benefit for executives eligible to participate in the SERP is based upon a formula equal to (i) 2.0% of the average of the five highest consecutive years of earnings (consisting of salary and bonus, but excluding stock compensation, and determined without regard to the limits imposed on tax-qualified plans) during the last 10 years of employment times years of service up to twenty years plus (ii) 1.45% of such earnings for the next fifteen years plus (iii) at the discretion of the Committee, 1% of such earnings for years of service beyond thirty-five years less (iv) Social Security old-age benefits (and similar benefits provided in foreign jurisdictions) attributable to employment with the Company and the Company-funded portion of the executive's Pension Plan benefits.\u00a0 In the case of Mr.\nIn addition, under the AIB Plan, the Committee has structured annual incentive bonuses that also qualify for this exemption.\u00a0 However, the Committee believes that Shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards result in non-deductible compensation expenses.\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with the Company's management.\u00a0 Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.\nThis report is respectfully submitted on February 22, 2017 by the members of the Compensation Committee.\nThe amounts in this column, computed in accordance with current Financial Accounting Standard Board guidance for accounting for and reporting of stock-based compensation, represent the aggregate grant-date fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock (market condition) awards issued by the Company for the respective fiscal years.\u00a0 The grant-date fair market values of the time-based restricted stock awards were as follows:\u00a0 Mr.\nBourque:\u00a0 $103,484 for 2016.\u00a0 The grant-date fair market values of the performance-based restricted stock, assuming instead that the highest level of performance conditions were to be achieved, would be as follows:\u00a0 Mr.\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards\nThe following table provides information about the annual incentive bonuses that the Company's NEOs were eligible to receive in 2016 under the Company's 2015 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan and stock-based awards granted in 2016 to each of the Company's NEOs under the Company's 2013 Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plan.\u00a0 There can be no assurance that the fair value of the performance-based stock awarded to the Company's NEOs in 2016 will ever be realized by the NEOs.\u00a0 For further information and the assumptions made in determining the grant-date fair values of the stock awards, see Notes\u00a0A and P to the Company's financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nGrant Dates of Equity Awards\n2016 Grant\nThe performance measures are based upon the Company's total shareholder return (&quot;TSR&quot;) versus the TSR of a defined peer group of companies that are described in &quot;Compensation Discussion and Analysis \u2013 Long-Term Equity Incentives&quot; above.\u00a0 The vesting of the performance-based shares from the 2016 award will occur in January 2019, with the actual number of shares vesting dependent upon the Company's TSR compared to that of the peer group.\u00a0 For further details, refer to Note P, &quot;Stock-Based Compensation&quot; to the Company's financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\u00a0 Rights to the performance-based shares are not forfeited upon death or disability and remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.\u00a0 Performance-based shares may not be forfeited upon retirement at the discretion of the Committee and, if not forfeited, remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.\u00a0 Performance-based shares vest upon a &quot;change in control&quot; of the Company based upon the Company's TSR as compared to that of the peer group at the time of the &quot;change in control.&quot;\nThese amounts represent the grant-date fair value of time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock awarded in 2016.\u00a0 The grant-date fair value of the time-based restricted stock is the $48.47 per share closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the award for all NEOs except Mr.\nBourque.\u00a0 The grant-date fair value of the performance-based shares is $51.05, except for Mr.\nBourque's award, the grant-date fair value of the time-based restricted stock is the $53.87 per share closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the date of the award.\u00a0 The grant-date fair value of the performance-based shares is $55.95 and is based on a Monte Carlo valuation model.\u00a0 The Committee has determined that approximately two-thirds of the targeted value of stock awards to NEOs should be performance-based.\u00a0 In order for the Company in 2016 to deliver two-thirds of the value of an NEO's targeted long-term equity incentive in performance-based restricted stock, somewhat more than one-third of the total number of shares granted were time-based restricted shares, and somewhat less than two-thirds were performance-based restricted shares because the prescribed valuation methods under FASB ASC Topic 718 result in higher per unit values for performance-based restricted stock than for time-based restricted stock.\nRepresents grant to Mr.\nRepresents grant to Mr.\nRepresents grant to Mr.\nRepresents grant to Mr.\nRepresents grant to Mr.\nThe following table shows the number of shares covered by exercisable and unexercisable options (under &quot;Option

2016.\u00a0 These outstanding equity awards have been granted to the Company's NEOs under the Company's 2006 and 2013 stock-based incentive compensation plans.\nof Securities Underlying Unexercised\nExercise\nKelly's 40,000 unexercised exercisable options reported under this column were exercised on February 10, 2017.\nThese amounts represent outstanding unvested performance-based restricted stock at target levels.\u00a0 The range of shares to be received is 0 to 200% of the target based on the levels of performance achieved under the 2014 award from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, under the 2015 award from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017, and under the 2016 award from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018.\u00a0 The number reported does not include any additional shares that may be awarded based upon the Company's performance but does include shares that may be forfeited based on the Company's performance.\u00a0 The vesting date for the performance-based shares awarded in 2014 was January 3, 2017.\u00a0 For information relating to the 2017 performance-based share vesting, see &quot;Compensation Discussion and Analysis \u2013 Long-Term Equity Incentives.&quot;\u00a0 Rights to the performance-based shares are not forfeited upon death or disability and remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.\u00a0 Performance-based shares may not be forfeited upon retirement at the discretion of the Committee and, if not forfeited, remain subject to attainment of the performance goal.\u00a0 Performance-based shares vest upon a &quot;change

table shows the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock acquired and the actual value received during 2016 upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of stock awards.\nof Shares Acquired on Exercise\nValue Realized on Exercise (1)\nThe annual benefit for the NEOs under the SERP is based upon a formula equal to (i) 2.0% of the average of the five highest consecutive years of earnings during the last 10 years of service (consisting of salary and bonus, but excluding stock compensation, and determined without regard to the limits imposed on tax-qualified plans) times years of service up to twenty years plus (ii) 1.45% of such earnings for the next fifteen years plus (iii) at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, 1% of such earnings for years of service beyond thirty-five years less (iv) Social Security old-age benefits (and similar benefits provided in foreign jurisdictions) attributable to employment with the Company and the Company-funded portion of the

form of stock options, with the award vesting over a three year period, subject to acceleration in the case of certain termination events; and (iv) an annual equity grant under the 2011 Plan (or any successor plan) in the form of performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs) with a target fair market value of $1 million per year during the three-year term of the CEO Employment Agreement.\nWarwick, with each annual grant vesting in one year.\nWarwick is terminated without cause or leaves the employment for &quot;Good Reason&quot; (other than resulting from a Change of Control), he shall be entitled to receive the Accrued Obligations, a cash severance payment equal to the present value of his base salary through the expiration date of the CEO Employment Agreement, COBRA premium payments for health coverage for up to 18 months, accelerated vesting / exercisability of his RSUs and stock options and a partial year discretionary bonus provided that the applicable performance criteria for the period in question have been met.\nQuinton, who commenced employment at the Company on January 6, 2020, is entitled to receive: (i) a base salary at the rate of $600,000 per year; (ii) three annual equity incentive grants, each with three year vesting, under the 2011 Plan and valued at $500,000 each (60% of each grant to be made in the form of restricted stock units

70% of her base salary; (iv) a one-time cash sign-on bonus of $300,000 and (v) relocation assistance.\nBedi was entitled to exercise any stock options then held by him for a period of ninety days after his termination.\nUnder the MSPP, which was adopted in 1999 in order to provide an additional incentive for senior management, including the Named Executive Officers, to invest in Common Stock through the use of their cash bonuses paid under the MIP, eligible members of senior management may use such annual cash bonus payments on a tax-deferred basis to purchase restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) in the Company at a 25% discount from the lowest closing price as reported on NASDAQ in the fiscal quarter in which the bonus is paid.\nNewman, who are Named Executive Officers, are receiving bonuses from the discretionary pool under the MIP and making deferrals under the MSPP.\nRepresents the grant date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718 of awards of restricted stock units

for fiscal 2019.\nThe compensation cost is computed using the grant date fair values for the purchase dates in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, under FASB ASC Topic 718 of $5.62 and $9.55, respectively, multiplied by the number of RSUs purchased in that fiscal year.\nUnder the 2011 Plan, restricted stock units are entitled to dividend earnings from the date of grant.\nGRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS\nThe

following table shows the number of shares of Common Stock acquired during fiscal 2021 upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units.\nExercise\nExercise\nAccordingly, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to benefits upon termination of their employment or a change-in-control only as provided for in respect of stock options and restricted stock units previously granted the 2011 Plan and previously purchased RSUs under the MSPP specifically negotiated arrangements.\nBecause the HRCC (which administers each of these plans) has this power and may, in its discretion, choose to exercise such power in connection with a change-in-control or similar event (such as a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity or the acquisition of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by a single person or group), the Company has presented information in the table on page 30 below regarding potential pay-outs to the Named Executive Officers upon a change-in-control based on the assumption that the HRCC would use its authority to accelerate vesting of restricted stock units and stock options and convert restricted stock units to shares under these plans effective upon a change-in-control of the Company.\nAs described in \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis-Options to Purchase Common Stock and Restricted Stock Units\u201d above, the Company has granted to its Named Executive Officers, with the exception of Mr.\nNon-qualified stock options\u00a0granted under the 2011

year before the date of retirement.\nAnnual bonuses are discretionary, unless contractually-obligated, and are therefore omitted from the table.\nNumber of securities tobe issued upon exerciseof outstanding options,warrants and rights(a)\nIncludes 289,142 shares of Common Stock available at May 31, 2021 under the ESPP; 305,952 shares of Common Stock available at May 31, 2021 under the MSPP; 661,092 shares of Common Stock available at May 31, 2021 under the 2011 Plan and 229,137 shares of Common Stock available at May 31, 2021 under the 2017 Director Plan, which shares may be issued upon the exercise of stock options or upon vesting of restricted stock units.\u00a0\u00a0\nGrant Foundation, a trustee of the Data Quality Campaign, a trustee of the Panasonic foundation, a board member of the Annenburg project and a trustee of the Teachers College of Columbia University Advisory Council.\u00a0\u00a0He is past chair of the Reporting and Dissemination Committee of the National Assessment Governing Board.\nIn the intervals between meetings of the Board, the Executive Committee is authorized to exercise, with certain exceptions, all of the powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company.\nHuman Resources and Compensation Committee.\nYoung are the current members of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the \u201cHRCC\u201d).\nThe amendments provide: (i) in the case of age, for a retirement age of 75 and that a director who has reached age 75 may not stand for re-election to the Board at the next annual meeting of stockholders following such director reaching age 75, subject to the right of the Board, in its discretion, to nominate or re-nominate a person who has attained age 75 for election if it believes that, under the circumstances, it is in the Company\u2019s best interests, and (ii) in the case of tenure, while no term limits shall apply, a \nExcept in limited circumstances, other than in connection with grants being made to new hires, the HRCC does not generally grant equity awards to Named Executive Officers at other times during a given year and, in such cases, the grants would normally be made by the HRCC at one of its other regularly scheduled meetings.\nAll equity awards are made at fair market value on the date of grant, which is no earlier than the date on which the HRCC approves the grant.\nUnder the 2011 Plan, fair market value is deemed to be the average of the high and low market prices of the Common Stock on the date of grant.\nThe HRCC has the authority and discretion to retain such external compensation consultants as it deems appropriate.\nRepresents the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021 under FASB ASC Topic 718.\nEach Outside Director, listed in the table above, had 2,636 restricted stock units outstanding as of May 31, 2021, and the fair value of such restricted stock units on the grant date, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, was $39.33 per restricted stock unit.\nRepresents the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options granted in fiscal 2021 under FASB ASC Topic 718.\nFor each Outside Director who received an option award during fiscal 2021, the fair value of such award on the grant date, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, was $10.38 per option.\nUpon the recommendation of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (the \u201cHRCC\u201d), the Board of Directors has unanimously approved and is submitting to the holders of the Class A Stock, for their consideration and approval, the Scholastic Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2021 Plan\u201d).\nThe 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d), which will expire on September 21, 2021, is the only plan under which equity awards may be granted to the Company\u2019s employees and consultants.\nStock options and restricted stock units have historically been the Company\u2019s principal form of long-term incentive compensation and have been granted as a means to motivate superior performance and to link directly the economic interests of executives and other key employees with those of stockholders.\nThe 2021 Plan also permits similar stock-based awards to be granted under certain conditions in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Committee will have the full authority and discretion to administer and interpret the 2021 Plan, including the authority: (i) to grant discretionary awards under the 2021 Plan, (ii) to determine the persons to whom discretionary awards will be granted, (iii) to determine the types of discretionary awards to be granted, which must be either non-qualified stock options or restricted stock units, (iv) to determine the terms and conditions of each discretionary award, (v) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each discretionary award, (vi) to prescribe the form or forms of instruments evidencing awards, and (vii) to make all other determinations and interpretations in connection with the 2021 Plan and awards made thereunder as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or desirable.\nThe Committee may also, in its discretion, extend or accelerate the exercisability of an award granted under the 2021 Plan, accelerate the vesting of or eliminate or make less restrictive any restrictions contained in any award, waive any restriction or other provision of the 2021 Plan or of any award or otherwise amend or modify any award in any manner that is not adverse to the participant to whom the award was granted.\nAwards under the 2021 Plan may not be made on or after September 22, 2031, the tenth anniversary of the date the Plan in expected to be approved by the holders of the Class A Stock of the Company, but awards granted prior to such date may extend beyond that date.\nPursuant to the 2021 Plan, all employees of, and consultants to, the Company or any of its affiliates are eligible to be granted non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units, if so determined by the Committee.\nThe Committee may award restricted stock units, which are grants of units that, upon vesting, are settled by delivery of an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock or as otherwise determined by the Committee.\nDividend equivalent units may be awarded in the discretion of the Committee.\nIf the grant by the Committee of restricted stock units is based on the attainment of performance goals, the Committee will establish for each recipient the applicable performance goals, formulae or standards and the applicable vesting percentages with reference to the attainment of such goals or satisfaction of such formulas or standards while the outcome of the performance goals are substantially uncertain.\nAlthough awards will generally be nontransferable (except by will or the laws of descent and distribution), the Committee may determine, at the time of grant or thereafter, that a stock option that is otherwise nontransferable will be transferable in whole or in \nThe rules concerning the federal income tax consequences with respect to non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units granted pursuant to the 2021 Plan are quite technical.\nIn general, a recipient will not realize any taxable income upon the grant of a restricted stock unit and the Company will not receive a deduction at the time of grant.\nBecause of the flexibility that the 2021 Plan provides, the cost of the 2021 Plan will vary depending on the terms of the individual grants awarded to employees.\nIn addition, the allocation of awards under the 2021 Plan is not currently determinable since such allocation is dependent upon future decisions to be made by the Committee in its sole discretion, subject to the provisions of the 2021 Plan.\nFor comparison purposes, please refer to the stock option awards under the Company\u2019s 2011 Plan in fiscal 2021, shown in the table titled \u201cGrants of Plan-Based Awards\u201d on page 24 herein.\nIn addition to the grants shown in that table, in fiscal 2021, 251,787 stock options were granted to other members of senior management as a group and 1,858,029 stock \noptions were granted to all other employees.\nAs a result of Covid-19 and its impact on the Company, a special one-time grant of stock options was made to the Company\u2019s manager-level and employees above in lieu of merit increases during fiscal 2021 and is not reflective of expected future grant patterns under the 2021 Plan.\nThe Scholastic Corporation 2017 Outside Directors\u2019 Stock Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock options to non-employee directors.\nGrants to non-employee directors are more fully described herein under the caption \u201cDirector\u2019s Compensation.\u201d \n2.6\u201cCAUSE\u201d means, with respect to the Termination of Employment of an employee or Termination of Consultancy of a Consultant, (i) in the case where there is no employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of the relevant grant or where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement in effect at such time, but such agreement does not define \u201ccause\u201d (or words of like import), termination due to a Participant\u2019s dishonesty, fraud, insubordination, willful \nmisconduct, refusal to perform services (for any reason other than illness or incapacity) or materially unsatisfactory performance of his or her duties for the Company or an Affiliate, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (ii) in the case where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of grant that defines \u201ccause\u201d (or words of like import), termination that is or would be deemed to be \u201cfor cause\u201d (or words of like import) as defined under such employment agreement or consultancy agreement at the time of grant, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.\n(\u201cNASDAQ\u201d); provided, however, that if and to the extent that no Committee exists which has the authority to administer this Plan, the functions of the Committee shall be exercised by the Board and all references herein to the Committee shall be deemed to be references to the Board.\n2.12\u201cDISABILITY\u201d means (i) in the case where there is no employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant in effect at the time of the relevant grant, or where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement in effect at such time, but such agreement does not define \u201cdisability\u201d, \u201ctotal and permanent disability\u201d, as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; (ii) in the case where there is an employment agreement or consultancy agreement between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant at the time of the relevant grant that defines \u201cdisability\u201d, \u201cdisability\u201d as defined under such employment agreement or consultancy agreement, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (iii) in the case of an Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code (\u201cSection 409A Award\u201d), \u201cdisability\u201d as defined in Section 409A(2)(C) of the Code.\nCompany\u2019s standard retirement policies as in effect from time to time or such other definitions of Retirement as the Committee may determine from time to time in its discretion.\u00a0\u00a0\n2.27\u201cSTOCK OPTION\u201d means any option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted to an Eligible Employee or Consultant under Article VI.\u00a0\u00a0\n2.29\u201cTERMINATION OF CONSULTANCY\u201d means (i) the expiration of the contract (or in the case of more than one contract, all contracts) under which services are performed by the Consultant for the Company or an Affiliate; or (ii) when an entity which is retaining a Participant as a Consultant ceases to be an Affiliate unless the Participant otherwise is, or thereupon becomes, a Consultant to the Company or another Affiliate at the time the entity ceases to be an Affiliate.\u00a0\u00a0In the event that a Consultant becomes an Eligible Employee or a non-employee director upon the termination of his or her consultancy, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may determine that no Termination of Consultancy shall be deemed to occur until such time as such individual is no longer a Consultant, an Eligible Employee or a non-employee director.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may otherwise define Termination of Consultancy in the Award Agreement or, if no rights of a Participant are reduced, may otherwise define Termination of Consultancy thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a Section 409A Award, \u201cTermination of Consultancy\u201d shall be interpreted to mean \u201cseparation from service\u201d as defined in Section 409A of the Code.\n2.30\u201cTERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT\u201d means: (i) a termination of employment (for reasons other than a military or personal leave of absence granted by the Company) of a Participant from the Company and its Affiliates; or (ii) when an entity which is employing a Participant ceases to be an Affiliate, unless the Participant otherwise is, or thereupon becomes, employed by the Company or another Affiliate at the time the entity ceases to be an Affiliate.\u00a0\u00a0In the event that an Eligible Employee becomes a Consultant or non-employee director upon the termination of his or her employment, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may determine that no Termination of Employment shall be deemed to occur until such time as such individual is no longer an Eligible Employee, a Consultant or a non-employee director.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may otherwise define Termination of Employment in the Award Agreement or, if no rights of a Participant are reduced, may otherwise define Termination of Employment thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0In the case of a Section 409A Award, \u201cTermination of Employment\u201d shall be interpreted to mean \u201cseparation from service\u201d as defined in Section 409A.\u00a0\u00a0\n3.1THE COMMITTEE.\u00a0\u00a0The Plan shall be administered and interpreted by the Committee.\u00a0\u00a0If for any reason the appointed Committee does not meet the \u201cnon-employee director\u201d or \u201coutside director\u201d requirements of Rule 16b-3, such noncompliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 shall not affect the validity of Awards, grants, interpretations or other actions of the Committee.\n3.2GRANTS OF AWARDS.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall have full authority and discretion to grant to Eligible Employees and Consultants, pursuant to the terms of this Plan, (i) Stock Options, (ii) Restricted Stock Units, or (iii) other awards providing benefits similar to Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units which are designed to meet the requirements of Foreign Jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0All Awards shall be granted by, confirmed by, and subject to the terms of, a written or electronic Award Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0In particular, the Committee shall have the discretionary authority:\n(a)to select the Eligible Employees and Consultants to whom Awards may from time to time be granted hereunder;\n(b)to determine whether and to what extent Awards, including any combination of two or more Awards, are to be granted hereunder to one or more Eligible Employees or Consultants;\n(c)to determine, in accordance with the terms of this Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;\n(d)to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, of any Award granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, the exercise or purchase price (if any), any restriction or limitation upon exercise, Performance Goals, any vesting schedule or acceleration thereof, and any forfeiture restrictions, or waiver thereof, regarding any Award and the shares of Common Stock relating thereto, based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, from time to time in any particular case, in its sole discretion);\n(g)to determine whether to require an Eligible Employee or Consultant, as a condition of the granting of any Award, not to sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option or other Award for a period of time as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, following the date of the acquisition of such Stock Option or Award;\n(h)to modify, extend or renew an Award, subject to Articles X and XIV herein, provided, however, that if an Award is modified, extended or renewed and thereby deemed to be the issuance of a new Award under the Code or the applicable accounting rules, the grant price of an Award may continue to be the original grant price even if less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time of such modification, extension or renewal; \n(i)to offer to buy out an Option previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time such offer is

(or any of its members) arising out of or in connection with this Plan shall be within the absolute discretion of all and each of them, as the case may be, and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all employees and Participants and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns and any persons claiming rights under this Plan or an Award.\u00a0\u00a0A Participant or other person claiming rights under this Plan may contest a decision or action by the Committee with respect to an Award or such other person only on the ground that

behalf of the Committee.\nliable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to this Plan or any Award granted under it.\u00a0\u00a0To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company (or if applicable, of an Affiliate), each officer and member or former member of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company (or if applicable, an Affiliate) against any cost or expense (including reasonable fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Company), and shall be advanced amounts necessary to pay the foregoing at the earliest time and to the fullest extent permitted, arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with this Plan, except to the extent arising out of such officer\u2019s, member\u2019s or former member\u2019s own fraud or bad faith.\nSuch indemnification shall be in addition to any rights of indemnification the officers, directors or members or former officers, directors or members may have under applicable law or under the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company or any Affiliate.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding anything else herein, this indemnification will not apply to the actions or determinations made by an individual with regard to

of shares of Common Stock underlying such unexercised or repurchased Stock Option shall again be available for the purposes of Awards under this Plan.\u00a0\u00a0If Common Stock has been delivered or exchanged by a Participant as full or partial payment to the Company of a grant price or the price of the purchase of an Award, the number of shares of Common Stock exchanged as payment in connection with the exercise or purchase shall again be available for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards.\u00a0\u00a0If Common Stock has been delivered by a Participant for payment of withholding taxes, or if the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable has been reduced for payment of withholding taxes, the number of shares of Common Stock delivered by such Participant or reduced for payment of withholding taxes shall again be available for purposes of determining the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards.\u00a0\u00a0\n(a)The existence of this Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize

which thereafter may be issued under this Plan, the number and kind of shares or other property (including cash) to be issued upon exercise of an outstanding Stock Option or other Award granted under this Plan and the purchase price thereof may be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as, and to the extent that, the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement (as determined by the Committee) of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under this Plan, and any such adjustment determined by the Committee in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and employees and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.\n(c)Fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from any adjustment in Stock Options or other Awards pursuant to Section 4.2(b) shall be aggregated until, and eliminated at, the time of exercise by rounding-down for fractions less than one-half and rounding-up for fractions equal to or greater than one-half.\u00a0\u00a0No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.\u00a0\u00a0\n(d)In the event of a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity or in the event of any transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of the Company\u2019s outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets (all of the foregoing being referred to as \u201cAcquisition Events\u201d), each outstanding Award will be treated as the Committee determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without a Participant\u2019s consent, including, without limitation, that (i) Awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent Awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or successor entity (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a Participant, that the Participant\u2019s Awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such Acquisition Event; (iii) outstanding Awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable, or payable, or restrictions applicable to an Award will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such Acquisition Event, and, to the extent the Committee determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such Acquisition Event; (iv) (A) the termination of an Award in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award \nor realization of the Participant\u2019s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Committee determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant\u2019s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment), or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing.\u00a0\u00a0In taking any of the actions permitted under this Section 4.2(d), the Committee will not be obligated to treat all Awards, all Awards held by a Participant, or all Awards of the same type, similarly.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.2(d) to the contrary, prior to any payment or adjustment contemplated under this Section 4.2(d), the Committee may require a Participant to\u00a0\u00a0bear such Participant\u2019s pro rata share of any post-closing indemnity obligations and be subject to the same post-closing purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and similar conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor the purposes of this Section 4.2(d), an Award will be considered assumed if, following the applicable transaction, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to such transaction, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in such transaction by holders of Common Stock for each share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration received in such transaction is not solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, the Committee may, with the consent of the acquiring or succeeding corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of a Stock Option or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each share of Common Stock subject to such Award, to be solely common stock of the acquiring or succeeding corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Acquisition Event.\u00a0\u00a0An Award that vests, is earned or is paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant\u2019s consent; provided, that a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation\u2019s post-Acquisition Event corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.\u00a0\u00a0\n5.1GENERAL ELIGIBILITY.\u00a0\u00a0All Eligible Employees and Consultants and prospective employees of and Consultants to the Company and its Affiliates are eligible to be granted Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units under this Plan or other Awards under this Plan providing benefits similar to each of the foregoing and which are designed to meet the requirements of Foreign Jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0Eligibility for the grant of an Award and actual participation in this Plan shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.\u00a0\u00a0The vesting and exercise of Awards granted to a prospective employee or Consultant are conditioned upon such individual actually becoming an Eligible Employee or Consultant.\n6.1STOCK OPTIONS.\u00a0\u00a0Stock Options granted hereunder shall not be incentive stock options intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code.\n6.2GRANTS.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any Eligible Employee or Consultant one or more Stock Options.\u00a0\u00a0\n6.3TERMS OF STOCK OPTIONS.\u00a0\u00a0Stock Options granted under this Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, and shall be in such form and contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable:\n(a)GRANT PRICE.\u00a0\u00a0The grant price per share of Common Stock shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of grant.\n(b)STOCK OPTION TERM.\u00a0\u00a0The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee; provided, however, that no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than 10 years after the date such Stock Option is granted.\n(c)EXERCISABILITY.\u00a0\u00a0Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant.\u00a0\u00a0If the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any Stock Option is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that such Stock Option is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitations on exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, waiver of the installment exercise provisions or acceleration of the time at which such Stock Option may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.\u00a0\u00a0Stock Options may not be exercised during any period prohibited by the Company\u2019s stock trading policies or applicable securities laws.\n(d)METHOD OF EXERCISE.\u00a0\u00a0Subject to whatever installment exercise, waiting period, and other provisions and limitations apply under Paragraph (c) above, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time and from time to time during the Stock Option term by giving notice of exercise to the Company, pursuant to such electronic or other procedures as may be specified by the Company or its Plan administrator from time to time, specifying the number of shares to be purchased.\u00a0\u00a0Such notice shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price as follows: \n(ii)if the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange, or quoted on a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., through a \u201ccashless exercise\u201d procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker approved by the Company to sell a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Stock Options and remit promptly to the Company an amount equal to the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes; or \n(iii)on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Company or its Plan administrator from time to time (including, without limitation, the relinquishment of Stock Options or by payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock owned by the Participant by either actual delivery or attestation (and for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances) based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the exercise date as determined by the Company or its Plan administrator).\u00a0\u00a0No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until payment therefor, as provided herein, has been made or provided for.\u00a0\u00a0\n(e)FORM, MODIFICATION, EXTENSION AND RENEWAL OF STOCK OPTIONS.\u00a0\u00a0Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of this Plan, Stock Options shall be evidenced by such form of written or electronic Award Agreement or grant as is approved by the Committee from time to time, and the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Stock Options granted under this Plan (provided that the rights of a Participant are not reduced without his or her consent).\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not reduce the grant price of a Stock Option and shall not exchange a Stock Option for a new Award with a lower (or no grant price) without approval of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and the laws of the State of Delaware.\n(g)AUTOMATIC EXERCISE.\u00a0\u00a0The Plan administrator may provide in a Stock Option Agreement or otherwise that any Stock Option outstanding on the last \nbusiness day of the term of such Stock Option (&quot;Automatic Exercise Date&quot;) that has a &quot;Specified Minimum Value&quot; shall be automatically and without further action by the Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, the Participant's personal representative or estate), be exercised on the Automatic Exercise Date.\u00a0\u00a0Payment of the grant price of such Stock Option may be made pursuant to such procedures as may be approved by the Plan administrator from time to time and the Company shall deduct or withhold an amount sufficient to satisfy all taxes associated with such exercise in accordance with Section 12.4.\u00a0\u00a0 For purposes of this Section 6.3(g), the term &quot;Specified Minimum Value&quot; means that the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock exceeds the grant price of a share subject to an expiring Stock Option by at least $0.50 cents per share or such other amount as the Plan administrator shall determine from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0The Plan administrator may elect to discontinue the automatic exercise of Stock Options pursuant to this Section 6.3(g) at any time upon notice to a Participant.\u00a0\u00a0The automatic exercise of a Stock Option pursuant to this Section 6.3(g) shall apply only to a Stock Option award that has been timely accepted by a Participant under procedures specified by the Plan administrator from time to time.\n7.1AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.\u00a0\u00a0Awards of Restricted Stock Units may be issued to Eligible Employees or Consultants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under this Plan.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee shall determine the Eligible Employees or Consultants to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock Units will be made, the number of units to be awarded, the time or times within which such Awards may be subject to forfeiture, the vesting schedule and rights to acceleration thereof, and all other terms and conditions of the Awards.\u00a0\u00a0An Award Agreement may condition the grant or vesting of Restricted Stock Units upon the attainment of Performance Goals or such other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.\n8.1PERFORMANCE GOALS, FORMULAE OR STANDARDS.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Awards under the Plan upon the attainment of specified performance goals (\u201cPerformance Goals\u201d) or such other factors as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion.\u00a0\u00a0Such Performance Goals may incorporate provisions for disregarding (or adjusting for) changes in accounting methods, corporate transactions (including, \n9.1NON-TRANSFERABILITY.\u00a0\u00a0Except as otherwise provided herein, no Stock Option, Restricted Stock Unit or other Award shall be Transferable by the

lifetime, only by the Participant.\u00a0\u00a0No Award shall, except as otherwise specifically provided by law or herein, be Transferable in any manner, and any attempt to Transfer any such Award shall be void, and no such Award shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person who shall be entitled to such Award, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such person.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Committee may determine at the time of grant or thereafter that a Stock Option that is otherwise not Transferable pursuant to this Section 9.1 is Transferable to, and exercisable by, a Family Member in whole or in part and in such circumstances, and under such conditions, as specified by the Committee.\u00a0\u00a0A Stock Option that is Transferred to a Family Member pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) may not be subsequently Transferred during the employee\u2019s lifetime other than to the employee or another Family Member, and (ii) remains subject to the terms of this Plan and the Award Agreement.\n(i)TERMINATION BY REASON OF DEATH OR DISABILITY.\u00a0\u00a0If a Participant\u2019s Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of death or Disability, all Stock Options held by such Participant shall become fully exercisable on the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy and may be exercised by the Participant (or, in the case of death, by the legal representative of the Participant\u2019s estate) at any time within a period of one year from the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated terms of such Stock Options.\nunvested Stock Options held by such Participant shall continue to vest and all exercisable Stock Options may be exercised by the Participant, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated terms of such Stock Options.\n(iii)INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE.\u00a0\u00a0If a Participant\u2019s Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by involuntary termination without Cause, all Stock Options held by such Participant may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Options.\n(iv)TERMINATION FOR CAUSE OR FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN DEATH, DISABILITY, RETIREMENT OR INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE.\u00a0\u00a0If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for Cause, all Stock Options held by such Participant shall thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy.\u00a0\u00a0If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for any reason other than Cause, death, Disability, Retirement, or other than an involuntary Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy without Cause, including, without limitation, a voluntary Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, all Stock Options held by such Participant may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Options.\n10.1TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board or the Committee may at any time, and from time to time, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of this Plan (including any amendment deemed necessary to ensure that the Company may comply with any regulatory requirement referred to in Article XII), or suspend or terminate it entirely, retroactively or otherwise; provided, however, that, unless otherwise required by law or specifically provided herein, the rights of a Participant with respect to Awards granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination may not be impaired

EMPLOYMENT/CONSULTANCY.\u00a0\u00a0Neither this Plan nor the grant of any Award hereunder shall give any Participant or other employee or Consultant any right with respect to continuance of employment or Consultancy by the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall they be a limitation in any way on the right of the Company or any Affiliate by which an employee is employed or a Consultant is retained to terminate his or her employment or Consultancy at any time.\n(a)Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, as long as the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange or system sponsored by a national securities association, the issue of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award shall be conditioned upon such shares being listed on such exchange or

exemptive condition under Rule 16b-3 and the Committee shall interpret and administer these guidelines in a manner consistent therewith.\u00a0\u00a0The Committee may establish and adopt electronic or other administrative guidelines, designed to facilitate compliance with Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, as it may deem necessary or proper for the administration and operation of this Plan and the

this Section 12.12.\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the grant of any Award or the payment of a share of Common Stock with respect to an Award or any election with regard thereto results or would result in a violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, any such grant, payment or election shall be deemed to be amended to comply therewith, and to the extent such grant, payment or election cannot be amended to comply therewith, such grant, payment or election shall be immediately cancelled and the Participant shall not have any rights thereto.\n14.1No Award

tenth anniversary may extend beyond that date.\nAny Performance Goals established for purposes of conditioning the grant of an Award based on performance or the vesting of performance-based Awards, shall be based on one or more of the following performance criteria either individually, alternatively, or in any combination applied either to the Company, an Affiliate or any business unit thereof, individually, alternatively, or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, or on an absolute basis or relative to previous year\u2019s results or to a

Awards\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and approving the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and\u00a0the other Named Executive Officers, and administering Vishay's incentive compensation and equity-based plans.\n\u00a0of which 75% vests only upon the achievement of three-year performance metrics and the balance of which vests on January 1 of the third year following the grant date\nSome of the compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table, including certain equity-based compensation, deferred cash compensation, retirement benefits, and phantom stock units,\u00a0has not yet been\u00a0realized by the executives, and in the case of equity-compensation measured on the grant date, might never be fully realized.\nAccordingly, we grant stock awards with multi-year vesting periods and our performance-based RSUs vest based on three-year performance results to encourage our officers to focus on long-term performance.\u00a0An annual\u00a0vote would allow our executive compensation programs to be evaluated\u00a0regularly and in relation to our long-term performance.\nCompensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors; and\nCompensation Committee\nAn annual grant of RSUs on the first stock trading day of the year, determined as a total incentive value of $165,000 divided by the closing stock price of the last trading day of the previous fiscal year, vesting in 3 years or ratably upon earlier cessation of service.\nAmounts represent the fair value of the RSUs granted, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 in the year of grant and the assumptions set forth in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K filed on February 15, 2019.\nThe grant-date fair value is recognized for accounting purposes over the respective vesting periods.\nCompensation Committee Charter\nExecutive Committee - The Executive Committee is authorized to exercise all functions of the Board of Directors in the intervals between meetings of the Board to the extent delegated by the Board and as permitted by Delaware law.\u00a0 The current chairman of the Committee is Mr.\nCompensation Committee - The functions of the Compensation Committee include evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer; establishing and approving all compensation for our Executive Officers; making recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation of non-management directors; making recommendations to the Board with respect to, and administering, our incentive compensation plans and equity based compensation plans; and performing other related functions specified in the Committee's charter.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee is authorized, within the limits of the 2007 Stock Incentive Program of Vishay\u00a0(the &quot;2007 Program&quot;), to determine the individuals who are to receive grants, including stock, stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), and the vesting requirements with respect to those grants, and to administer and interpret the plan.\u00a0\u00a0The current chairman of the Committee is Mr.\nThe chairman of\u00a0the Compensation Committee\u00a0presides at the executive sessions of the Board's independent directors.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee considers risk issues when establishing and administering our compensation programs for executive officers and other key personnel.\nThe Board and its Committees exercise their risk oversight function by carefully evaluating the reports they receive from management and by making inquiries of management with respect to areas of particular interest to the Board.\nA stockholder wishing to recommend to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee a candidate for election as director must submit the recommendation in writing, addressed to the Committee, care of our Corporate Secretary, at Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., 63 Lancaster Avenue, Malvern, PA 19355.\u00a0 Submissions must be made by mail, courier, or personal delivery.\u00a0 E-mailed submissions will not be considered.\u00a0 Submissions recommending candidates for election at an annual meeting of stockholders must generally be received no later than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the prior annual meeting of stockholders.\u00a0 In the event that the date of an annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days following the first anniversary date of the annual meeting of stockholders for the prior year, the submission must be made a reasonable time in advance of the mailing of our proxy statement for the current year.\u00a0\u00a0 Each nominating recommendation must be accompanied by the information called for by our &quot;Procedures for Securityholders' Submission of Nominating Recommendations,&quot; which is posted on our website.\u00a0 This includes specified information concerning the stockholder or group of stockholders making the recommendation and the proposed nominee, any relationships between the recommending stockholder or stockholders and the proposed nominee and the qualifications of the proposed nominee to serve as director.\u00a0 The recommendation must also be accompanied by the consent of the proposed nominee to serve if nominated and elected and the agreement of the nominee to be contacted by the Committee, if the Committee decides in its discretion to do so.\nThe following table shows the number of shares of Vishay common stock and Class B common stock beneficially owned by (a) each director and director nominee, (b) each &quot;Executive Officer&quot; identified under &quot;Executive Compensation,&quot; (c) the directors, director nominees, and executive officers of Vishay as a group, and (d) any person owning more than 5% of Vishay common stock or the Class B common stock.\u00a0 Unless otherwise noted, the information is stated as of March 18, 2019, and the beneficial owners exercise sole voting or dispositive power over their shares.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNo member of the Compensation Committee was at any time during 2018 an officer or employee of Vishay or any of the Company's subsidiaries nor was any such person a former officer of Vishay or any of the Company's subsidiaries.\u00a0 In addition, no Compensation Committee member is an executive officer of another entity at which one of the Company's executive officers serves on the board of directors.\nOfficers serve, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, until the meeting of the Board of Directors next following each annual meeting of stockholders, subject to their rights under any contracts of employment described under &quot;Compensation Discussion and Analysis.&quot;\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes and approves all compensation for all Executive Officers and administers Vishay's incentive and equity-based compensation plan.\nSEC disclosure rules require tabular presentation regarding the compensation of the registrant's principal executive officer (&quot;PEO&quot;), principal financial officer (&quot;PFO&quot;), and the registrant's three mostly highly compensated executive officers other than the PEO and PFO.\u00a0 Because the Compensation Committee determines compensation for all Executive Officers, this Compensation Discussion and Analysis discusses compensation of all eight of our Executive Officers.\u00a0 The required &quot;Compensation Tables&quot; beginning on page\u00a045 include only the five executives required to be disclosed in this manner by SEC rules.\nThe Compensation Committee and Vishay's management believe that compensation should help to recruit, retain, and motivate key employees who can function effectively both in periods of recession and economic expansion.\u00a0 Ordinarily an executive officer's total compensation should consist of a combination of cash payments and equity awards, to achieve the right balance between short- and long-term performance.\u00a0 Equity-based compensation should serve to align the interests of management with those of stockholders.\u00a0 Severance protection and retirement benefits should provide executives with an appropriate level of job security, commensurate with their contributions to the Company and their tenure.\nThe Compensation Committee, in consultation with Dr.\nThe Company's compensation philosophy is intended to integrate with its philosophy of evaluating operating performance.\u00a0 The Company utilizes several measures and metrics to evaluate its performance, as further described in &quot;Performance Measures and Metrics&quot; below, and in turn, the Compensation Committee utilizes similar measures in evaluating executive officer compensation.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the elements of compensation for the Company's senior executives reward intrinsically sound management decisions and do not encourage risk taking to enhance short-term profitability at the expense of the long-term health and viability of the enterprise.\u00a0 While the design of our executive compensation program is primarily performance-based, we do not believe that it encourages excessive risk-taking.\u00a0The Committee believes that the Company's senior executives have taken a prudent approach to corporate risk management.\u00a0In addition, the Company has in place a risk management program designed to identify, evaluate and control risks.\nThe factors considered by the Compensation Committee in evaluating the risks arising from compensation arrangements, which have been incorporated into the terms and conditions of such compensation arrangements, include, in no particular weighting or order of prominence:\nWhile annual cash bonuses focus on the achievement of short-term or annual goals and short-term goals may encourage risk-taking, annual cash bonuses for Executive Officers are capped in order to balance the risk; and\nPaul, have this type of agreement.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation arrangement with Mr.\nThe Compensation Committee reviews the total compensation level of our Executive Officers each year, considering individual performance, prior years' compensation level, recent operating results, operating results of competitors, projections for the future, other components of the executive pay packages, perceived salary trends in executive base salary among the peer group of Vishay and input on executive performance from the Chief Executive Officer.\nThe determination is subjective and the Compensation Committee does not assign any quantitative weight to these factors.\u00a0\nIn 2016, the Compensation Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (&quot;PwC&quot;) to advise on compensation matters as the Committee considered 2017 compensation, upon the appointment of new Executive Officers.\nThe Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant in 2018 as no significant changes to executive compensation took place and no new Executive Officers were appointed during the year.\nThe peer group of companies were recommended by PwC and accepted by the Compensation Committee, and included the following public companies:\nAfter considering the salaries and compensation practices of executive officers of comparable public companies identified by PwC, the total compensation of the executive officers was based on a determination by the Compensation Committee that it was appropriate to establish a mix of cash and equity compensation that was reasonable when compared to, but not necessarily within, the market-competitive range of compensation offered to similarly situated executives of comparable public companies.\nIn addition to the information provided by PwC, the Compensation Committee considered the roles that each executive plays and is expected to play in Vishay's operations, development, and strategic planning.\u00a0 Our succession plan provides for the transition of Mr.\u00a0Zandman into the role of Chief Executive Officer upon the eventual retirement of Dr.\nVandoorn, Valletta, and Gebhardt.\u00a0 This same metric, for a multi-year period, is also used in connection with performance-based RSUs granted for all Executive Officers.\u00a0 Although the term &quot;free cash&quot; is not defined in GAAP, each of the elements used to calculate &quot;free cash&quot; is presented as a line item on the face of our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP as follows:\nAt the grant date, the Compensation Committee may provide for certain pre-defined adjustments to this metric.\u00a0 For the performance-based RSU's granted in 2018, the free cash target measure was adjusted by adding the total cash paid pursuant to restructuring programs disclosed in the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nZandman, as mentioned above,\u00a0reflect their positions and tenure as\u00a0executive officers\u00a0of the Company.\u00a0 As such, these agreements include compensation components other than base salary, cash performance-based incentive compensation, and equity-based compensation, which are not available to our other Executive Officers.\u00a0 These other components include deferred compensation, certain additional severance benefits, annual grants of phantom stock units, and customary welfare and retirement benefits.\nThe minimum base salary levels for the Executive Officers are fixed in their respective employment agreements.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee determined the minimum base salaries, based upon the executives' salary level, present responsibilities, expectations with respect to future responsibilities and a comparison to peer group executive salaries.\u00a0The Compensation Committee selected the group of peer group companies on the advice of PwC.\u00a0 Compensation practices in the peer group were only one of the factors considered by the Compensation Committee.\u00a0 The base salaries of Dr.\nOver many years, we have viewed adjusted net earnings as the primary indicator of the performance of our executive management team.\u00a0 As more specifically addressed below, adjusted net earnings refers to net earnings determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to eliminate the after tax effects of items, positive or negative, that do not relate to our intrinsic operations.\u00a0 These items include, among others, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, severance and restructuring costs, special tax items, and other items, such as unusual gains or losses that impact GAAP net earnings, not reflecting on-going operating activities.\u00a0 The calculation of adjusted net earnings is set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K as well as under the heading &quot;Performance Measures and Metrics&quot; in this proxy statement.\u00a0 We utilize this measure in part because it eliminates factors that mask the actual performance of on-going operations and because of its currency with other public companies in our industry.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that the incentive compensation of Dr.\nZandman, is a straight percentage of adjusted net earnings pursuant to the\u00a0Cash Bonus\u00a0Plan, and other elements of such bonuses are expressed as a percentage of base salary, measured against specific performance goals.\u00a0 Performance goals for purposes of the annual bonus award are recommended by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Compensation Committee.\n(1) Amount paid limited by the cap set by the Compensation Committee\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nZandman is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee following the end of the year, and each executive is assigned a performance score for several categories.\u00a0 For a discussion of 2018 goals and achieved results for the other Executive Officers, see &quot;Evaluation of Achievements for Cash Performance-Based Incentive Compensation.&quot;\nThe 2007 Program permits the grant of up to 6,500,000 shares of restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units (&quot;RSUs&quot;), stock options, and phantom stock units to officers, employees, and non-employee directors.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the grant of equity awards is the primary tool for aligning interests of the executive officers with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders.\u00a0 Accordingly, the Compensation Committee includes a long-term incentive (LTI) component in the form of equity-based compensation in each of the executives' employment agreements.\nIn establishing the amount of equity awards, the Compensation Committee utilized the market-competitive range of equity awards granted to similarly situated executive officers of the peer group companies.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee concluded that a grant of equity awards within such market-competitive range was appropriate to reward and incentivize our executive officers.\nThe employment agreements of the Executive Officers provide for annual grants of equity based compensation in the form of RSUs.\u00a0 Of the total RSUs granted, 25% are in the form of time-vested RSUs that carry only a service condition.\nThe PBRSUs will vest at the conclusion of the three\u2013year performance periods if certain defined performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee (based on adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and/or free cash over a three year period) are realized.\n50% of the PBRSUs will vest if 80% of the applicable objective is met, and the proportion of PBRSUs subject to such criterion will increase by 2.5% for each additional 1% of the applicable objective (between 80% and 100%).\u00a0 For 2018, the grants were sized based upon a percentage of base salary, as of the date of grant, as follows:\nThe number of RSUs granted annually to each executive is determined by multiplying the executive's base salary for the applicable year by the respective percentage set forth above and dividing by the closing price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day preceding January 1 of the applicable year.\u00a0 The time-vested RSUs carry only a service condition and vest on January 1 of the third year following the grant.\u00a0 The PBRSUs include performance conditions agreed to with the Compensation Committee in its role as administrator of the 2007 Program (based on adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, and/or free cash over a three year period).\u00a0 Performance-based targets related to the PBRSUs are set at levels intended to be attainable without the need to take inappropriate risks.\nThe PBRSUs contain a three-year service period and are subject to the Compensation Committee certifying that all performance criteria have been satisfied.\nIn 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded the following RSUs (including PBRSUs) to certain executive officers:\nFor financial accounting purposes, the grant-date fair value is determined on the date that the Compensation Committee approves the number of RSUs to be granted under this provision.\u00a0 Accordingly, the value of the grant on that date will be different than the LTI value described in the table above.\nBeginning in January 2017, any RSUs granted to such executive officers that remain outstanding at the time of such executive officer's retirement after age 62\u00a0in accordance with the terms of his or her employment agreement with the Company shall, in the case of time-vested RSUs, become fully vested upon such retirement and, in the case of PBRSUs, vest if and to the extent the applicable performance criteria are met in accordance with current vesting schedules.\nThe PBRSU awards granted in 2014, 2015, and 2016 vested on January 1, 2017,\u00a0January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2019, respectively, as the performance obligations associated with those awards were met in full.\nThe PBRSU awards granted in\u00a02017, 2018, and 2019\u00a0are\u00a0expected to vest as the performance obligations associated with those awards are\u00a0expected to be met, but remain subject to the Company's actual performance.\nZandman receive annual grants of 5,000 phantom stock units.\u00a0 The grants are made under the 2007 Program.\nSimilar to the deferred cash compensation described below, the Compensation Committee considers the grant of phantom stock units in the nature of a retirement benefit and an inducement to loyalty to Vishay over time.\nThe number of units to be granted annually was determined at the inception of the 2004 agreements.\u00a0 The cumulative increase in the number of phantom stock units held by the executives over time also is intended to strengthen the alignment of executive and stockholder interests in the long-term appreciation of Vishay's equity value.\nThe Compensation Committee also considers the award of extra-contractual equity-based compensation, when appropriate.\u00a0 However, no such additional equity awards were granted to any Executive Officer in 2018.\nZandman each have a long-standing relationship with the Company, and we expect that each will continue to serve Vishay for so long as their services are desired and they can make effective management contributions.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee therefore considers this deferred compensation in the nature of a retirement benefit and an anticipatory reward for loyalty to Vishay over time.\u00a0 \nThe Compensation Committee believes that providing adequate postretirement benefits commensurate with position is essential to retaining qualified individuals for long-term employment.\u00a0 Vishay maintains pension and retirement programs for, or makes certain government retirement programs available to, most of its employees around the world, including its Executive Officers.\u00a0 The retirement benefits for Executive Officers pursuant to these programs are not materially preferential to those of other employees in those respective countries.\nZandman in 2010, the Compensation Committee determined to extend the severance benefits for these executives to also include any termination (other than for cause)\u00a0after age 62.\u00a0 This provision was added in light of the long-standing tenure of these executives and to ensure a smooth transition upon their retirement.\nWe provide executive officers with perquisites and other personal benefits that Vishay and the Compensation Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program.\u00a0 These perquisites are not intended, however, to constitute a material portion of the executive's compensation package.\u00a0 In general, the perquisites, while not integral to the performance of an executive's duties, must bear some relationship to the executive's employment and be of perceived benefit to Vishay.\u00a0 The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to Executive Officers.\nThe Compensation Committee believes that severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination of employment are part of a standard compensation package for senior executives.\u00a0 The terms of these severance provisions are discussed in &quot;Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control.&quot;\nTo the extent actual was less than the budget, the determination of an appropriate partial bonus percentage would be made by the Compensation Committee in consultation with the CEO.\nTo the extent actual was less than the budget, the determination of an appropriate partial bonus percentage would be made by the Compensation Committee in consultation with the CEO.\nVandoorn's incentive compensation was limited by the one-time base salary cap set by the

Compensation Committee in consultation with the CEO.\nTo the extent actual was less than the budget, the determination of an appropriate partial bonus percentage would be made by the Compensation

actual was less than the budget, the determination of an appropriate partial bonus percentage would be made by the Compensation Committee in consultation with the CEO.\nThese benefits are required by Israeli law or employment practices generally, and were taken into account by the Compensation Committee in formulating the overall compensation package for our executive officers.\nAs part of its role, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the tax deductibility of executive compensation.\u00a0 The exemptions for performance-based compensation had a significant influence on the historical design of our executive compensation programs.\u00a0 Although, the Company will not receive the benefit of deductibility for new awards of performance-based compensation that are in excess of the $1 million deductibility cap, the Compensation Committee continues to view pay for performance as an important part of our executive compensation policy.\nOn August 21, 2018, the Compensation Committee and the Board reviewed and considered the Board's recommendation to the Company's stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation (&quot;say on pay&quot;) every three years (&quot;say on frequency&quot;).\n2019 Proxy Statement | Report of the Compensation Committee\nREPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes and approves all compensation for all Executive Officers and administers Vishay's incentive and equity-based compensation plan.\u00a0 Because the Compensation Committee determines compensation for all Executive Officers, the &quot;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&quot; section discusses compensation of all eight of our Executive Officers.\u00a0 The compensation tables which follow include only the five executives required to be disclosed in this manner by SEC rules (&quot;Named

the grant-date fair value for the PBRSUs.\u00a0\u00a0 The common stock underlying the RSU and PBRSU awards is not received until the awards are vested (in some cases, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions) and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.\nColumn (e) also includes the grant-date fair value of 5,000 phantom stock units awarded annually to certain Named Executive Officers pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements.\u00a0 The common stock underlying these awards is not received until termination of employment, and accordingly, there can be no assurance that the grant-date fair value of these awards will ever be realized.\nZandman and Vandoorn was limited by the caps set by the
