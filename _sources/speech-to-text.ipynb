    "# Speech-to-text\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='purple'>**Whisper**</font> is a speech-to-text service provided by **OpenAI**. It relies on **ASR** (Automatic Speech Recognition) technology, which is used to convert spoken language into written text.  The system is trained on 680,000 hours of audio and the corresponding transcripts collected from the internet. English-language audio matched to English transcripts, non-English audio matched to English transcripts, and non-English audio matched to the corresponding transcript comprise 65%, 18%, and 17% of the data, respectively. Altogether, Whisper can translate audio from 99 different languages. It supports the following file types: _m4a_, _mp3_, _webm_, _mp4_, _mpga_, _wav_, and _mpeg_.\n",

Our profits have surged faster than admiration for an Allama Iqbal poem. As we celebrate our success, it's with a heavy heart that we have to bid farewell to our esteemed CFO, Mr. Chacko Khan, who's been as sweet as our treat. His dedication has been integral to our growth, much like the chocolate covering our unique confections. And now, the moment that marks a new chapter for us, introducing our delightful line of chocolate-covered rickshaws with Kashmiri chai sprinkles. Hum duniya ko chocolate se muskarate hue banate hain. Let's keep shaping the world with a chocolate-covered smile.\")\n",
