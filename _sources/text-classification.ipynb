    "### Supervised learning and classification tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reviewing some of the basics of machine learning. Supervised learning is the process of training a model using labelled data to predict the same values on unlabelled data. There are two types of supervised learning problems: classification and regression. The former is the process of predicting a label that can be categorized into one of two or more categories while the latter predicts a continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_images/supervised_learning.png\" width=\"600pix\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classification is a supervised learning task specifically. Natural language processing (NLP) models would require pre-labelled classification of \"documents\" (e.g., any collection of text: a PDF, an article, a tweet) and the potentially painstaking process of feature engineering to train a model to output the correct classifcation of unlabelled documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can replace other machine learning tasks for classification of texts. Unlike NLP models that require pre-labeled training data or a pre-defined vocabulary of words or n-grams (i.e., feature engineering), LLMs allow for zero-shot or few-shot learning to label text-like data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "1) sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews\n",
    "2) categorize customer support requests (refund, complaint, login issues, etc.)\n",
    "3) SPAM filter\n",
    "4) Hate speech or inappropriate speech detection on social media\n",
    "5) Topic identification of articles"

    "\n",
    "We want to send a prompt to the AI that explains the task and the desired output. We may not need to be super precise when working with Chat GPT, but if we are working with code, we need to be more thoughtful about our design as we want a consistent output that won't trip up in automation. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify the output format: in this example, we want to classify the text into one of three categories of sentiments -- positive, negative, or neutral. We could tell GPT to output one of those texts, or more simply, an integer coded to one of those values. Also, a single integer is one token and therefore the cheapest output the API can give us (remember that both input and output token counts contribute to the overall cost of prompts)! You may also want a Python list, tuple, or maybe even a JSON, CSV, or HTML file for more complex information. Any of these are possible: just be specific! You can also specify a limit on the number of output tokens when initializing the LLM. If you are asking for output in a coding language, you might want to also specify the version (i.e., Python 2 vs 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide examples: Examples are the equivalent of providing a training set to supervised learning models; however, the list of examples does not nearly need to be as vast as a traditional training set. LLMs are pre-trained zero-shot learners, which means they can do a fairly good job at generating the desired output without the user needing to do any fine-tuning. However, providing a few examples of what the output should look like, or \"few-shot learning\", can make the model much more reliable. I gave a single example and was able to get consistent results; but feel free to provide more.\n",
